How to keep your dog still for eight minutes: Trainer reveals 'treats and trust' were key to keeping canines calm in scanners for groundbreaking study



It is a groundbreaking study into how humans communicate with dogs - and a triumph of canine training.Earlier this week researchers revealed how dog brains process speech, and found canines care about both what we say and how we say it.Now they have revealed how they trained the thirteen animals to lie completely motionless in an fMRI scanner for eight whole minutes while wearing earphones and a coil on their heads.Scroll down for videoResearchers used fMRI to analyze the dogs’ brain activity as the animals listened to each combination - and the Hungarian trainer who managed to keep canines still in in an fMRI scanner for eight minutes while wearing earphones and a coil on their heads has now revealed how she did it.'fMRI provides a non-invasive, harmless way of measurement that dogs enjoy to take part of,' said Márta Gácsi, ethologist, the developer of the training method, and author of the study.Six border collies, five golden retrievers, a German shepherd and a Chinese crested were used in the research.'Most of them were really young,' Gácsi told the Washington Post.Some of the animals were already trained assistance dogs for disabled people, but some were completely untrained.According to Gácsi, the key was trust.'We need dogs that trust the owner. As in the case of a child, you say, maybe you won’t see me, but I will be there.'She admits the team tested animals and found some highly trained dogs failed, because they wanted to do something.'They wanted to do their best, but they couldn’t understand that here the task is doing nothing.'The dogs were trained using treats, and some became frustrated after just thirty seconds.'We use social learning and, of course, we use food rewards as well.'Researcher Anna Gábor is talking to Barack. Dogs were exposed to recordings of their trainers’ voices as the trainers spoke to them using multiple combinations of vocabulary and intonation, in both praising and neutral ways.In the first trasining stage, dogs are lying motionless and listening to their trainer during the research.In the first part of the training, the dogs were trained to lie on the floor with their head between their paws, then to do the same on a table.The table was then moved slightly to get them used to going into the scanner, and finally the earphones were fitted, and tied on with cloth.However, Gácsi said the biggest problems was the dogs wanted to run into the scanner room because of the noise inside it, describing it as similar to a disco.The table was then moved slightly to get them used to going into the scanner, and finally the earphones were fitted, and tied on with cloth.Barack is lying on the fMRI bed, and inside the machine as a scan is takenBasic training took between five to 20 sessions. It depends on the dog, with another ten to get them used to the scanner, she said.'We measured dogs' brain activity as they listened to their trainer's speech,' explains Anna Gábor, PhD student, author of the study.'Dogs heard praise words in praising intonation, praise words in neutral intonation, and also neutral conjunction words, meaningless to them, in praising and neutral intonations.Dogs are listening to their trainer, Márta Gácsi during the training process for the experiment. Basic training took between five to 20 sessions.'We looked for brain regions that differentiated between meaningful and meaningless words, or between praising and non-praising intonations.'It discovered that dogs, like people, use the left hemisphere to process words, and the right hemisphere brain region to process intonation.Dogs were exposed to recordings of their trainers’ voices as the trainers spoke to them using multiple combinations of vocabulary and intonation, in both praising and neutral ways.Researchers used fMRI to analyze the dogs’ brain activity as the animals listened to each combination.For example, trainers spoke praise words with a praising intonation, praise words with a neutral intonation, neutral words with a praising intonation, and neutral words with neutral intonation.Researchers used fMRI to analyze the dogs’ brain activity as the animals listened to each combination.Their results reveal that, regardless of intonation, dogs process vocabulary, recognizing each word as distinct, and further, that they do so in a way similar to humans, using the left hemisphere of the brain.Also like humans, the researchers found that dogs process intonation separately from vocabulary, in auditory regions in the right hemisphere of the brain.Lastly, and also like humans, the team found that the dogs relied on both word meaning and intonation when processing the reward value of utterances.The dogs were trained outside the machine to lie still so the readings could be takenIt found praise activates dog's reward centre only when both words and intonation match, according to the new study in Science.Researchers also say dogs developed the neural mechanisms to process words much earlier than thought.'The human brain not only separately analyzes what we say and how we say it, but also integrates the two types of information, to arrive at a unified meaning.'Our findings suggest that dogs can also do all that, and they use very similar brain mechanisms,' said lead researcher Attila Andics of Department of Ethology and MTA-ELTE Comparative Ethology Research Group at Eötvös Loránd University in Budapest.Trained dogs around the fMRI scanner used in the study: Dogs, like people, use the left hemisphere to process words, and the right hemisphere brain region to process intonation, according to the new study in Science.Andics and colleagues also found that praise activated dogs' reward centre – the brain region which responds to all sorts of pleasurable stimuli, like food, sex, being petted, or even nice music in humans.Importantly, the reward centre was active only when dogs heard praise words in praising intonation.'It shows that for dogs, a nice praise can very well work as a reward, but it works best if both words and intonation match.'So dogs not only tell apart what we say and how we say it, but they can also combine the two, for a correct interpretation of what those words really meant.
