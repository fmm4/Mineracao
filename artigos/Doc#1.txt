Is this why your calls keep cutting out? iPhone models are WORSE than competitors for antenna signal



Apple's iPhone 6s is one of the worst rated smartphones for call quality, claims a new report.The news is worse for those who hold their phone in their left hand as the antenna signal gets slightly better for right-handed users, according to the research.The rankings are part of a study carried out on behalf of telecomms authorities in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Finland, reports TheLocal.se.The iPhone 6s, which was launched in 2015 with a new '3D Touch' screen, has been ranked among the worst for antenna signal when used in the left handWorking with the Nordic Council of Ministers, Professor Gert Frølund Pedersen, from Denmark's Aalborg University, ranked 26 of the most popular mobile phone models in the new report.The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6s Plus were at the bottom of the list when used in the left hand with the iPhone 6 and the smaller iPhone SE also found at the bottom of the rankings.The Apple handsets all performed slightly better when used in the right hand.'Apple has had problems and they continue to have them,' Mr Pedersen told Danish news agency Ritzau.'It also seems that the problems are greater in their newer phones, which is incredible.'The iPhone SE, which sports a more square design that Apple's other current handsets, was also ranked poorly for antenna reception in the new reportApple is expected to unveil its next-generation iPhone 7 at an event on Wednesday.The HTC Desire 626 was ranked as having the best phone signal when used in the right hand, with the Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini and budget Samsung Galaxy J1 also scoring well.While the findings are compelling, the results concentrate on phone use and mobile phone networks Scandinavia, so signal reception could well vary between regions.The experiments were also carried out using dummy heads and hands to replicate smartphone users, so it may not accurately reflect the way people use mobile phones.The experiment used a dummy head and hands in an attempt to replicate the experience of left- and right-handed phone users making calls and a hand to test data receptionThe Samsung Galaxy S5 Mini (pictured) was one of the best scoring smartphones for signal in the testsThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.Copy link to paste in your message
