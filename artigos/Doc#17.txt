That really is tech support! Computers could offer praise and reassurance when they detect you getting stressed



For most of us computers are source of stress as we get error messages, spinning beach balls and random crashes blighting our use of them.But they could soon help us cope better in stressful or emotionally difficult situations by providing a few words of support.Researchers are developing an algorithm that aims to offer praise and reassurance just when people need it.Computers are more often a source of stress, but they could soon be offering emotional support and words of encouragement to their users. Scientists have developed an algorithm to provide praise and reassurance when people need it (stock picture of stressed worker)They have been studying which messages of support can be most effective when, for example, someone is recovering from an injury or is having a stressful day.They hope that eventually the AI system will be able to detect when people are reaching a low point and offer them some words of encouragement to help pick them up.Professor Judith Masthoff, an expert in e-health at Aberdeen University, hopes the system could help to combat some of the early stages of mental health problems.Speaking to New Scientist, she said: ‘There’s a lot of need for emotional support at the moment. We have increased rates of mental health issues.‘I would like people to have their own guardian angel that could support them emotionally throughout the day.’The system would build on the development of chatbots that use artificial intelligence to respond to people over social media or online messaging forums.Some firms are already using chatbots to engage with customers for simple problems.But Professor Masthoff’s software could help to talk down emotionally distressed customers or tackle the angry ones before they speak to a real person.She believes, however, the system may find more use as a sort of informal care that can help support us during our everyday lives at stressful times.Computer algorithms could detect when someone is struggling from the way they interact with their smartphone or computer – perhaps by looking for keywords in messages or even at the way they type.Professor Masthoff’s team, however, are looking at how the computer system would then respond once signs of distress have been detected.In a series of experiments, they looked at the type of emotional support people gave to students with different types of personalities and test scores.They have also examined the responses participants might give to help support an individual who is suffering from high levels of stress in different situations.By combining these results they have developed an algorithm that could offer feedback that may help someone in a difficult situation.They stipulated that the system generate messages that contained two emotional support statements.The algorithm could provide messages of support such as 'take your time', 'be glad you can help' and 'you are doing a great job' when it detects that users are struggling. Researchers believe it may help to tackle the early stages of mental health issuesIn one example, a stressed first aider struggling to help a patient would be told: ‘I know how you feel but this will be over soon. You will get through this.’Other messages included statements like: ‘Take your time’, ‘Be glad that you can help’ and ‘you are doing a great job’.The key, however, will be ensuring the statements are generated at the right time and in the right context to ensure they don’t seem empty.Writing in the journal International Journal of Human-Computer Studies, Professor Masthoff and her colleagues said that portraying the computer system as a peer or a superior at work could help to boost the effectiveness of the statements.They said: ‘People may be reluctant to believe that they can receive emotional support from a computer and an investigation is needed into how best to provide support to somebody while they are in a stressful situation – either audibly or visually.
