'They are actually video clips made of panoramas of still photography stitched together, and folks on the ground have made a video clip of them,' Williams explained.'Clear day over a busy New York harbor,' he tweeted, adding 'Hopefully more sunshine in store as #Hermine drifts away.'He also posted a video appearing to show a trip down the Hudson.However, if fact it was simply a pan of the giant high resolution picture taken using the ISS's cameras and stitched together on Earth.'They are actually video clips made of panoramas of still photography stitched together, and folks on the ground have made a video clip of them,' he explained.The ISS has several cameras on board, and a selection of lenses for them.It also has a cupola, which Williams described as a 'Window on the World' to give a wide angle view.Astronauts have used hand-held cameras to photograph the Earth for more than 40 years.Beginning with the Mercury missions in the early 1960s, astronauts have taken more than 1.5 million photographs of the Earth.Earlier this year, Scott Kelly launched into the record books after spending the most cumulative days in space for any US astronaut, with 520 days 10 hours and 33 minutes.He also posted a video appearing to show a trip down the Hudson. However, if fact it was simply a pan of the giant high resolution picture taken using the ISS's cameras and stitched together on Earth.But as of last month, the torch has been passed to International Space Station commander Jeffrey Williams, who just logged his 521st day in orbit.Williams is the second American to break the record this past year, and he will have spent a total of 534 days away from the planet by the time he returns to Earth.'To be a part of it, in the beginning, in the middle, finishing out the station and now when it's in the full utilization mode — that's really the bigger story to me personally,' Williams said from orbit.Williams is a Wisconsin native who was selected for the Nasa Astronaut Class of 1996.In addition to his space flights, he has performed various technical duties in both the space shuttle and International Space Station Programs.A veteran of four spaceflights, Williams arrived at the ISS in March, just a few weeks after Kelly had completed his year-long stay on the ship.Williams is the current commander of the station's Expedition 48 crew and is scheduled to return to Earth on September 6.'It is an honor to spend any day in space and certainly, to have accumulated that time is truly an honor for me,' said Williams in a NASA interview recorded in July.Kelly joined the team at Mission Control in Houston, Texas today to congratulate Williams on surpassing the record.'I wanted to congratulate you on passing me up here in total number of days in space, it is great to see another record broken and especially by a Sardine', Kelly said speaking to Williams on the telephone, referring to the Astronaut Class of 1996.'I have one question for you.''Do you have 190 more days in you?'Scott Kelly (pictured) left earth as a Nasa astronaut and come home as 'Ironman' after setting the record for the most cumulative days in space with 520 days 10 hours and 33 minutes. But joined the team at Mission Control in Houston to congratulate Williams for the new record'That questions is not for me,' Williams replied.'That question is for my wife.'Peggy Whitson (pictured) is expected to surpass Williams' 534 total days during her upcoming mission on the space station with her launch that begins in NovemberKelly spent nearly a year in space and returned to Earth on March 1 with a total of 520 days in space, as part of an experiment to test the effects of long-duration spaceflight on the body and mind ahead of a potential future mission to Mars.The all-time record for cumulative days spent in space is held by Russian cosmonaut Genny Padalka, who racked up 879 days over his career and wrapped up his final mission in September 2015.'It is a great privilege to be part of this,' Williams said in March on Nasa television.'I feel very ready to be going back to the space station.'Williams, like Kelly, will hold the American cumulative time in space record for a short time, as another astronaut is already set to break.Peggy Whitson is expected to surpass Williams' 534 total days during her upcoming mission on the space station with her launch that begins in November.
