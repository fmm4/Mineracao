The 'justice league for AI': Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft form artificial intelligence ethics board (but Apple is NOT part of it)



From job automation to fears of a robot uprising, the growth of artificial intelligence has spurred numerous concerns over the future of humanity, many of which have long been stoked by science fiction.But now, the tech giants of Silicon Valley are working to take on the most pertinent challenges before they can even arise.Researchers with Alphabet, Amazon, Facebook, IBM, and Microsoft have teamed up to create a standard of ethics for the development of AI, with hopes that establishing guidelines can help to ensure that future technologies are intended solely for the benefit of humankind.Scroll down for videoFrom job automation to fears of a robot uprising, the growth of artificial intelligence has spurred numerous concerns over the future of humanity, many of which have long been stoked by science fiction.

In many of these domains, including transportation, home and service, health care, and education, artificial intelligence has already made its presence knownIn the report, the group calls for the government to raise awareness and expertise about AI, along with increased public and private spending on this type of technology.And, the researchers have even provided a glossary so non-technical readers can understand the various applications of these systems, along with their definitions and intent.The AI100 will release a report every year for the next century on the different aspects of artificial intelligence as it continues to grow.‘AI technologies can be reliable and broadly beneficial,’ says Barbara Grosz, chairwoman and Harvard computer scientist who first led the AI100 standing committee in 2015.‘Being transparent about their design and deployment challenges will build trust and avert unjustified fear and suspicion.’The five tech giants are now circulating a memorandum, and the organization could be announced as early as mid-September.
