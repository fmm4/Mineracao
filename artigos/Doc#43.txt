Apple will unveil wireless 'AirPod' headphones alongside iPhone 7 that DOESN'T have an audio socket (but you'll have to pay extra for them)

It is set to be a highly controversial move - but it appears Apple really will kill off the headphone socket tomorrow.Multiple reports have claimed the move will force users to use either the lightning connector or wireless headphones.Now, a leading analyst has revealed Apple will also unveil its own wireless headphones, called AirPods, at the event.Scroll down for videoA mockup of the new AirPod, which Apple could reveal tomorrow alongside the iPhone 7.The firm is expected to bundle a set of headphones with the iPhone 7 that have a wired, lightning connector.Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities told clients 'Apple will likely have its own-designed Bluetooth-like communication chip and launch own-brand Bluetooth headphones targeting the high-end market, with Beats positioned in the midrange market,' according to AppleInsider.With its own custom "Bluetooth-like" chip, Kuo believes Apple could use proprietary low-power wireless communications for other functions beyond headphones, including smart home accessories and an intelligent automobile.Last week, a Russian filing has revealed Apple is also developing new wireless headphones called 'airpods' to sell alongside its current 'earpod' headphones.However, the patent shows the firm is also developing its own Apple, rather than Beats branded wireless alternatives.The filings were to the EEC, the main regulatory body for the Eurasian Economic Union, which consists of Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Russia.Another rumor regarding Apple's much-awaited iPhone 7 (pictured is a concept drawing of the iPhone 7) has surfaced. Speaking to Bloomberg , a source said not to expect the MacPros to debut at an 'event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone'They show Apple gained 'active' certification status for a wireless headphone product dubbed 'AirPods' alongside three other models to be marketed under the Beats brand.It comes days after the co-founder of Apple warned the iPhone maker not to kill off the headphone socket in its upcoming model.Steve Wozniak said a lot of customers will be frustrated if Apple removes the headphone jack - and claimed wireless headphone simply aren't good enough.'If it's missing the 3.5 mm earphone jack, that's going to tick off a lot of people,' Wozniak told The Australian Financial Review.'I would not use Bluetooth … I don't like wireless.'I have cars where you can plug in the music, or go through Bluetooth, and Bluetooth just sounds so flat for the same music.'A leading analyst has revealed Apple will also unveil its own wireless headphones, called AirPods, at the event.Android handsets use a wireless standard called AptX, which has better quality - but Apple has not backed it yet.Wozniak said he expects people will still be able to connect wired headphones into the lightning port of the iPhone, but they will have to have an adapter.'Mine have custom ear implants, they fit in so comfortably, I can sleep on them and everything.'And they only come out with one kind of jack, so I'll have to go through the adapter,' he said.'But we'll see. Apple is good at moving towards the future, and I like to follow that.'According to a Bloomberg source, the next-generation versions of the iPhone are due to debut on September 7.Steve Wozniak said a lot of customers will be frustrated if Apple removes the headphone jack - and claimed wireless headphone simply aren't good enough.This information coincides with news from last month that pre-orders for the new handsets will begin on September 9.Speaking to Bloomberg about the MacBook Pros, a source said these laptops 'aren't likely to debut at an event currently scheduled for September 7 to introduce next-generation versions of the iPhone'.Forbes was the first to spot this leaked information from Mark Gurman, who has made a name for himself with accurate Apple leaks for 9to5Mac and is now a journalist for Bloomberg.This comes just a month after Evan Blass tweeted Apple owners should get ready to place their pre-orders on September 9.Blass has also made claims that the iPhone 7 line should hit shelves as soon as September 16.This statement is the second time this week that Bloomberg released explicit news about the design of Apple's next-generation iPhones.Earlier this week, Bloomberg release information that suggests next month's iPhone is expected to be much different from what is in your hand.The larger iPhone 7 will be equipped with a dual-camera system designed to capture brighter photos with more detail.John Sculley, flanked by co-founders of Apple, Steve Jobs (left) and Steve Wozniak (right), unveiling the briefcase-size Apple IIc to more than 3,000 dealers and software sector representatives at Moscone Center on 24 Apr 1984.This upgrade is just one of many rumors surrounding the iPhone 7 designs, as both models are set to have a home button that reads different inputs, but will be missing the traditional headphone jack.'The standout features will be a dual-camera system on the larger iPhone, a re-engineered home button that responds to pressure with a vibrating sensation rather than a true physical click and the removal of the devices' headphone jack, said the people, who didn't want to be identified discussing unannounced features,' reports Mark Gurman from Bloomberg.Although the handsets may be designed with new features, display sizes are not expected to change.The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus will have the same 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screens as their predecessors.Sources also told Bloomberg that Apple removed the two innermost antenna lines that line the back of the current phones.This statement is the second time this week that Bloomberg released explicit news about the design of Apple's next-generation iPhones. The larger iPhone 7 will be equipped with a dual-camera system designed to capture brighter photos with more detail. And the headphone jack could be replaced with a second speakerThe dual camera has been a long running rumor for the iPhone 7 and just a few months ago, a patent surfaced that illustrates this technology - sending the internet into a frenzy over the iPhone 7 Plus having 'superzoom' capabilities.According to Bloomberg's sources, who claim to have used a prototype of the highly anticipated devices, this new system will snap brighter pictures in low-light environments and with more detail.However, the dual-camera system will only be available to those who dish out the extra bucks for the larger iPhone.The lenses, which each snap colour differently, will merge together to make one detailed image.This technology would also allow users to zoom in on the object, place or person with more clarity, sources said.Although this could be another one of the many rumors, September 7 coincides with Evan Blass's tweet from last month that reveals pre-orders for the iPhone 7 will start on September 9.The home button has not been discussed too much this year, but it seems Apple could have big plans for this mechanism in the new models.'Current home buttons are switches that physically press into the phone, but the new models will have a pressure-sensitive button that employs so-called haptic feedback,' according to Bloomberg's' sources.This technology is expected to be similar to the trackpads implemented in the latest MacBook line and what was reported by 9TO5Mac earlier this year.Sources told the Ben Lovejoy that although the home button will still be a physical mechanism, it will 'feature haptic feedback to simulate a click using the same approach as Force Touch' – which was a new addition to the iPhone 6 line.And the rumor that can be heard echoing all over the internet might actually be true.Numerous leaks and sources have surfaced over the past year reveaingl a major change in the the upcoming iPhones, no headphone jack, which Bloomberg says will be replaced with a second speaker.Users will also have to make use of connectivity using Bluetooth and the charging port to setup wireless headphones.Another rumor hit the internet just last month that put an even bigger twist on the mystery, claiming next month's Apple smartphones will not be called the iPhone 7 at all.Instead, it will be called the iPhone 6SE - leaving the iPhone 7 for next year, when apple is expected to introduce a major overhaul of its iconic handset.The report from Apfelpage comes from Chinese supply chain sources, who claim to have have seen packaging and labeling that indicates the new phone will be called the 'iPhone 6SE'.'Given the more-iterative changes and similar design, it is not out of the question for Apple to brand the new iPhone as a continuation of the iPhone 6 line,' says 9to5Mac.
