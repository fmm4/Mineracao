Drivers who talk on their hands-free mobiles while at the wheel are more at risk of having a rear-end shunt, scientists warn



Talking on a hands-free mobile while driving raises the risk of having a rear-end shunt, scientists warn.A new study has found that motorists' brains become overloaded during phone conversations, costing them milliseconds of reaction time when the car in front brakes sharply.And it makes no difference whether they are using legal hands-free kits or breaking the law by having the handset clamped to the side of the head.The research emerged a week after a coach driver was jailed for five years for causing the deaths of two passengers in an accident.Talking on a hands-free mobile while driving raises the risk of having a rear-end shuntMartin Chun, 60, was in a 'telephone-induced stupor' after spending eight minutes chatting hands-free when the vehicle careered off the road in Cornwall and crashed.Researchers from the Universities of Central Florida and Beijing Jiaotong selected 42 men and women aged between 30 and 40 and with driving licences.They were put behind the wheel of a car on a driving simulator and asked to negotiate an urban dual carriageway behind a vehicle driving at 50 kph (31 mph), which then slows to 40 kph (25 mph) before stopping suddenly.Each participant had three sessions in the simulator so they could perform emergency stops while holding a mobile to their head, while talking hands-free and without distraction – though the running order was chosen at random.To mock up the effects of having a conversation, drivers had to respond to a series of maths questions played over a speaker.Of the 126 emergency stops, seven ended in rear-end shunts, all of them involving mobile use, four of them hands-free.There were a further 15 near-misses – twelve of them involving mobiles, seven of them hands-free.Drivers with no distractions were faster to react when there was a large gap between the vehicles and quicker to apply the brakes.Those on the phone were quicker to spot danger when the cars were closer together and braked harder, suggesting that those using mobiles were aware that what they were doing was dangerous and so over-compensated.However, they were still more likely to crash.The study – in the journal Accident Analysis and Prevention – concludes: 'Even though they took a series of compensation behaviours to mitigate the risk, the cell phone use drivers still encountered higher risk than the drivers without [them].'Many governments have introduced legislation banning only for the use of hand-held cell phone while driving, but allowed the use of hands-free technology for conversing.'However, the results supported the notion that the use of hands-free phones impaired driving performance in the same way as the use of hand-held phones, indicating that the driving impairment to a large extent was a result of cognitive degradation, rather than physical distractions.'It is therefore recommended that drivers do not engage in any cell phone use (either hand-held or hands-free) while driving.'Motorists have been banned from using hand-held mobiles since 2003 with offenders facing fines of up to £100 and three penalty points.But the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents is calling for the law to be extended.Head of road safety Kevin Clinton said: 'Sadly, people continue to lose their lives on our roads in crashes caused by drivers who are distracted because they use a phone.'This can so easily be avoided by all drivers switching off their mobiles while driving and only checking messages once they have stopped in a safe place.'Research clearly shows that using a hands-free phone does not significantly reduce the risks because the problems are caused mainly by the mental distraction and divided attention of taking part in a conversation at the same time as driving.And it makes no difference whether they are using legal hands-free kits or breaking the law by having the handset clamped to the side of the head'Ideally, when the law was introduced, it would have made hands-free mobiles illegal to use.'It is difficult for the police to detect drivers using them just by observation, but they can see if a person's driving is affected because they are distracted and, for more serious crashes or offences, phone records can be checked.'Sussex University psychologists recently found that the area of the road that hands-free drivers concentrate on is up to four times smaller than the average road user.Last week, Chun was jailed for five years for causing the death by dangerous driving of Margaret Luxton, 59, and Carol Muldoon, 68, and leaving four others seriously injured.They were among 51 passengers on an Age Concern day trip to Looe in Cornwall when the coach driver lost control on a bend and the vehicle ploughed into a hedgerow.Jailing Chun, Judge Simon Carr told Truro Crown Court: 'There was no other possible cause of the accident other than the use of the phone.'At the point of the collision, you had been on the phone for eight minutes. That could never have been safe.'Earlier, prosecutor Stephen Mooney told the jury Chun had been in a 'telephone-induced stupor'.
