Want to buy a used robot? Terrifying 1965 PDAD humanoid used to test spacesuits will be offered at auction



Before Neil Armstrong took one giant leap on the moon, Nasa looked to a robot for help with testing the crew's spacesuits.The 1965 PDAD (Power Driven Articulated Dummy) robot simulated 35 basic human motions and used sensors to gather data on how the human body would act in pressurized suits - but it never fulfilled its mission due to a tendency to leak oil.Now, the metallic astronaut is set to be sold along with 100 other 'Remarkable Rarities' from RR Auction, who has marked Nasa's reject robot with an $80,000 price tag.Scroll down for videoThe 1965 robot was able to simulate 35 basic human motions and used sensors to gather data on how the human body acted in a pressurized suit - but it never fulfilled its due to its tendency to leak oil'Only two of the test robot's were produced — the other is on display and owned by the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum,' Robert Livingston, RR Auction executive vice president, in a statement to collectSpace.'This [robot] was purchased as surplus from the University of Maryland.'The auction will be hosted online starting September 15 and finish with a live sale at the Royal Sonesta Boston on September. 26.The 'Power Driven Articulated Dummy' project was under Contract No. NAS 9-1370 and ran from May 22, 1963 through July 31, 1965.It was originally built for Nasa's Manned Spacecraft Center by the Illinois Institute of Technology.The reason for a test dummy was officials hoped to use it during design and testing of a spacesuits, which might otherwise be painful, tedious or even dangerous for human beings.Weighing in at 230 pounds, the life-size android was made height adjustable from 5 feet 5 inches to six feet two inches so it could simulate the average American male from the fifth to ninety-fifth percentile.The movements of the robot were powered by hydraulic actuators created by oil flowing through a nylon-tube circulatory system, and controlled by the operator from a separate console.The hydraulic system could not handle the pressure needed to move the robot's extremities without leaking, and despite some creative test solutions, including outfitting it with a scuba wetsuit (pictured is a snap when Nasa was still conducting the program in the 1960s)Weighing in at 230 pounds, this remarkable robot stands as a testament to the innovative creativity of NasaThe exterior is covered with a 1/32-inch thick aluminum skin with cutaways to allow freedom of motion, and the facial section of the fiberglass head is removable for access to the interior connections.However, even though its creators successfully created an impressive robot during this time - it could swivel its hips, raise and lower its arms and legs, shrug its shoulders, clench its fists and even shake hands – it was never able to complete its mission.The hydraulic system could not handle the pressure needed to move the robot's extremities without leaking, and despite some creative test solutions, including outfitting it with a scuba wetsuit, the problem was never solved.Nasa ultimately tossed out the project and decided to use the funding elsewhere.But, this remarkable robot stands as a testament to the innovative creativity the space agency inspired in its quest skyward.Today, the space dummy is missing a forearm and hand, scuffs and dings can be seen on its body and some of its wiring is frayed or damaged.Only two of these robots were create, the one selling for $80,000 and another that is owned by the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum.
