Google's self-driving cars could soon detect the POLICE: Patent shows how AI will dodge emergency vehicles



Google is one of the main contenders when it comes to developing a self-driving car.The company has previously revealed plans for its cars to be able to predict what drivers are going to do next, as well as drive slowly around children.Now, according to a patent filed by Google, the firm is working on a way to allow its smart cars to get out of the way of police and other emergency vehicles.Google has filed a patent that will allow its smart cars to get out of the way of police and other emergency vehicles. The patent (diagram pictured) will use filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency servies'A system and method is provided for detecting and responding to emergency vehicles,' the patent application says.'In one aspect, one or more computing devices may identify a set of light sources from an image based at least in part on one or more templates, and may filter the set of light sources in order to identify one or more light sources corresponding to a potential emergency vehicle.'The technology uses filters to detect the red and blue flashing lights used by emergency services.Software will also determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights.However, as with the raft of patents granted to Google, it is unclear if the technology will come to fruition at this stage.Google is one of the main contenders when it comes to developing a self-driving car.

In doing so, it will make sure it does not create an accident by driving itself into a tree or off a bridge, for example.'Autonomous vehicles may...use the cameras, sensors, and global positioning devices to gather and interpret images and sensor data about its surrounding environment, for example, oncoming vehicles, parked cars, trees, buildings' the patent says.Google has been working on its smart vehicle since 2009, with testing being carried out on the roads around its Mountain View headquarters in California.Google says the technology will help reduce delays for the emergency service and cut down on the possible risk of crashes involving its own cars.A study last year found self-driving cars are far more accident-prone than ordinary cars, a new study has claimed.Researchers found self-driving vehicles had 9.1 crashes, compared to just 1.9 for those with a human operator.However, the report found that none of the accidents were the fault of the self driving car.Self-driving cars were also rear-ended 50 per cent more often than traditional vehicles, it found.However, the University of Michigan's Transportation Research Institute concluded 'self-driving vehicles were not at fault in any crashes they were involved in.'The technology will determine whether the lights are flashing or not, and will be able to identify which form of vehicle is approaching by noting the spacing of the lights, The car will then move out of the way of the emergency vehicle.
