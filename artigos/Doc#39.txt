Special Forces developing 'AI in the sky' drones that can create 3D maps of enemy lairs: Pentagon reveals $1m secretive 'autonomous tactical airborne drone' project



The Pentagon is developing its own 'AI soldier drones' that can hunt down the enemy and even fly inside buildings to give military bosses a look inside.A $1m Army award, awarded through a new Pentagon tech-focused 'Defense Innovation Unit Experimental' project, is for a nine-month 'prototype project in the area of Autonomous Tactical Airborne Drones'.It will work with a secretive firm called Shield AI to develop the systems.Scroll down for videoOne of Shield AI#'s drones in action: It can create a 3D map of a room and send it back to controllers.It is believed the units could be sent into buildings by special forces soldiers to create 3D maps, one of which is shown here.'Shield AI works with Special Operations Forces and other DoD units to deliver next generation intelligence, reconnaissance, and surveillance systems,' the firm says on its site.'We build AI to enable fully autonomous unmanned systems for battlefield applications.'However, there is no detail in the award about what the drones will be used for.The contract comes from the Naval Special Warfare Command, which mostly oversees Navy SEALs, and the contract was awarded to Shield AI.The only clue to the mission comes from videos posted to Shield AI's web site.One boasts 'Hit launch, autonomous exploration begins, hit return, autonomously flies back to you. No remote control, no pilot... full autonomy.'It is believed the units could be sent into buildings by special forces soldiers to create 3D mapsThe craft gradually builds a map, one layer at a time and its sensors scan the roomThe quadcopters, which appear to be modified commercial models with extra sensors attached, are shown exploring buildings, mapping the insides of spaces, and then transmitting that information back to humans who may soon need to go into that building.The maps are built up layer by layer, giving a perfect insight into a building's layout - and revealing anyone in it.'We solve the intelligence deficit in the last mile by giving robots and UAVs the ability to perceive their environment,' the firm says.'We build an autonomous micro-UAV companion for every Soldier, Marine, and Special Operator (Navy SEALs, Army Special Forces, Air Force Combat Controllers, etc.).'Launched from a distance it has the ability to reach inaccessible areas like urban canyons, indoor spaces, and other GPS-denied environments.'Collecting intelligence along the way, it resolves critical information deficiencies related to targeting, building clearances, and urban combat.'The quadcopters appear to be modified commercial models with extra sensors attachedThe firm boasts: 'Hit launch, autonomous exploration begins, hit return, autonomously flies back to you. No remote control, no pilot... full autonomy.''Once they can perceive their environment, they can explore, collaborate, and gather intelligence in their environment.'Our products provide forces with intelligence that removes the fog of war and allows them to make better more informed decisions.'Decisions that protect and save lives.
