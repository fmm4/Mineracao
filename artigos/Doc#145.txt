England face Pakistan in their third one-day international clash at Trent Bridge on Tuesday looking to secure a series victory.Eoin Morgan's side won a rain-hit opening encounter at the Ageas Bowl by 44 runs on the Duckworth–Lewis method last Wednesday, with Jason Roy and Joe Root among the runs before the wet weather set in.The hosts then followed that up with another comfortable victory at Lord's on Saturday.Having dismissed Pakistan for 251, England rattled off the required runs with four wickets and 15 balls to spare as Joe Root hit 89 and Morgan 68.The five-match series could be a foregone conclusion come the close of play on Tuesday, and seamer Liam Plunkett is aiming for a whitewash.'We want to win this series 5-0, not 3-0, so we're trying to focus on winning every game,' said Plunkett.'We won all the matches we needed to against Sri Lanka and it will be the same mind-set now.''We've not been at our best but we are still winning and that's a good sign.'It's good to be unbeaten this season and if we can carry on doing that it would be a great achievement.'
