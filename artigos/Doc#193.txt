Ante-post favourite Ivan Grozny is one of 63 horses still in contention for the Betfred Ebor at York



Favourite Ivan Grozny is one of 63 horses still in contention for the Betfred Ebor at York on Saturday.The talented dual-purpose performer bolted up over hurdles at Aintree in the spring and while he was subsequently disappointing in the Scottish Champion Hurdle, he was not disgraced at Royal Ascot and has since won emphatically at Tipperary and Galway.Ivan Grozny is one of two remaining entries to give Willie Mullins a second Ebor success after Sesenta in 2009, although Renneti appears unlikely to make the cut for the prestigious contest, with the safety limit set at 20 runners.Trainer Willie Mullins on the hunt for second Ebor success after Sesenta in 2009A formidable Irish contingent also includes the Tony Martin-trained pair of Heartbreak City and Quick Jack, who are guaranteed a place in the field.The weights are now headed by Richard Fahey's Suegioo, just ahead of Roger Varian's Battersea and Kinema from Ralph Beckett's yard.Major contenders for the home team include Charlie Appleby's Northumberland Plate hero Antiquarium, fellow Godolphin inmate Oceanographer and the Brian Ellison-trained Seamour.Godolphin racing manager John Ferguson said: 'I would suspect what we'll do is run Antiquarium and Oceanographer.'Antiquarium won a Northumberland Plate - he showed a good turn of foot - and he's training well.'Oceanographer won two weeks ago at Doncaster. He settled well that day and I think we'll see whether he gets the mile and six. Antiquarium, we know he gets the trip - Oceanographer, we're going slightly into unknown territory.'But bearing in mind the race is worth a lot of money, I think it's a risk worth taking.'No comments have so far been submitted.
