The secrets of the solar wind revealed: Stunning Nasa video shows 'rays' of particles as they leave the edge of the sun



It looks like a calm, orderly lab experiment at first glance.But in fact this incredible video shows the solar wind as it leave's the sun's surface - in stark contrast to the gusty and turbulent wind as it approaches Earth.Ever since the 1950s discovery of the solar wind – the constant flow of charged particles from the sun – there's been a stark disconnect between this outpouring and the sun itself.Scroll down for videoThis incredible video shows the solar wind as it leave's the sun's surface - in stark contrast to the gusty and turbulent wind as it approaches Earth.Near the sun where it originates, this wind is structured in distinct rays, much like a child's simple drawing of the sun, researchers found.However, the details of the transition from defined rays in the corona, the sun's upper atmosphere, to the solar wind have been, until now, a mystery.Using NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory, or STEREO, scientists have for the first time imaged the edge of the sun.'Now we have a global picture of solar wind evolution,' said Nicholeen Viall, a co-author of the paper and a solar scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.'This is really going to change our understanding of how the space environment develops.'The research, published in The Astrophysical Journal, shows for the first time the details of the transition from defined rays in the corona, the sun's upper atmosphere, to the solar wind.Conceptual animation (not to scale) showing the sun's corona and solar wind.

When this magnetic energy is suddenly released, this accelerates the hot gases near the surface, which can travel quickly towards the EarthSolar storms are eruptions of magnetic energy from the sun's surface.When this magnetic energy is suddenly released, this accelerates the hot gases near the surface, which can travel quickly towards the Earth.A solar flare's 'killer electrons' can travel at up to several million miles per hour towards Earth.Experts are now warning that humanity is not prepared to tackle a calamitous solar storm, and that the effects could be dire.If this material collides with the Earth's magnetic field, it can affect many technologies, including satellites orbiting the planet, and radars.In a new paper published in ROOM, Dr Joseph Pelton, said: 'Over the course of the last half century, the world has finally begun to learn that a massive asteroid or comet strike could create havoc and ruin, on perhaps a planetary scale.The Met Office now provides forecasts for space weather to help the public and industry prepare for solar storms that may pose a risk to infrastructure, as outlined in the graphic shown above'But what we don't have is a global understanding that there is a much more likely danger that is increasing over time and is a very real cosmic danger that could knock out our electric power grids, kill key satellite systems for communications and navigation and defence.'Dr Pelton also warned that a solar storm could knock out the time synchronisation of the global Internet.This synchronisation is essential for the internet to continue to function as it does.He added: 'A massive coronal mass ejection that brings millions of tons of ions travelling perhaps at two million kilometres an hour, could leave the world's economic systems and global infrastructure in shambles.'A magnetic map of Earth shows that the magnetic field is only strengthening is small areas (shown in red), and the field is weakening in most areas (shown in blue)However, Dr Pelton says that if scientists could create a mega-structure, with an huge electro-magnetic shield, it could protect the Earth from a massive solar storm.The structure could also have other purposes, such as incorporating solar power satellites which could beam clean energy back to Earth.Dr Pelton added: 'It is time for those leading our space agencies to consider what technologies they might conceive and implement to save Earth and the human race.'To put not too fine a point on it, now is the time for them to start doing their truly core mission to save Earth.'
