Who needs a runway! Watch the incredible triple transformer drone that takes off like a quadcopter and flies like a plane or a glider



It is the drone that can take off anywhere - but still fly at the speed of a plane.The Quantum Tron craft, boasts a top speed of 80 kilometers an hour,and a 160 kilometer range.The firm behind it says ti will be used for everything from creating 3D maps to deliveries.Scroll down for videoTo take off and land, the drone works like a quadcopter, lifting into the air of its four rotors'One of my big hobbies is flying gliders, which need to have a very high aerodynamic efficiency,' creator Florian Seibel told Digital Trends.'I had also flown helicopters in the military for some years, which of course also possess the ability to take off and land vertically.'My idea was to combine these two worlds into one system, and that's how the Quantum Tron was born.'It has a maximum payload of 5.5 pounds, and between 70-120 minutes of flight time depending on speed, and a wingspan of 11.5 feet.'Quantum Tron is a professional and high-performing UAV offering outstanding efficiency and elegance,' the firm says.Once in flight, the craft can turn into a plane and climb like a standard aircraft.Once in the air, the plane acts like a plane - and can even glide, shown hereThe system has been designed to flexibly, quickly and safely integrate different sensors in order to meet the needs of a variety of fields of application.'The transition combines long range and efficiency with the ability to vertically take off and land without additional equipment.'The firm boasts it can also autonomously and safely take off and land highly sensitive sensors on a small target.'We've produced about twenty pre-series prototypes which we've been flying a lot,' Seibel said.'Next we go to Intergeo, which is the largest trade fair in the world for 3D reconstruction and geo-information services.'After that, the plan is to enter the market in October with our first orders.'The firm has even been able to test the craft's takeoff and landing capabilities on a floating helipadOnce in flight, it flips into plane mode, operating like a normal propellor plane.However, the firm does face competition in the 'transformer' market.One Texas firm also hopes to build a vehicle with four rotors that allow it to take to the air anywhere like a helicopter - and then switch to fly like a normal plane.While this 'SkyCruiser' vehicle is still some way from development, the technology could soon become a reality in a functioning prototype dubbed the 'SkyProwler'.The SkyProwler has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-air.'This opens up flying to a much larger range of possible terrains, from backyards and rough fields, to a boat on the sea,' the company writes on its Kickstarter campaign.Users can instruct the aircraft to retract its landing gear and pull its four rotor props into the sides of its body.The SkyProwler (artist's impression pictured) has four horizontal propellers that allow it to perform vertical take-offs and landings, and to hover in mid-airUsers can instruct the aircraft to retract its landing gear and pull its four rotor props into the sides of its bodyPictured on the left is a prototype flown on April, and the right image shows what the current design looks likeIn this mode, the craft is powered by two rear props allowing it to cover bigger distances at 83 mph (134 km/h).For slow-speed flight, they craft's weight can be cut by temporarily removing its wings and tail. It will then travel at 35mph (56 km/h).According to Krossblade, flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed-wing.Nose cones on the drone can also be changed, allowing it to carry different gadgets such as a HD camera, according to a report in Gizmag.In 'hornet configuration', without the tail and wings, the craft has a range of 14 miles (22km) and in 'blade configuration' it can travel for 43 miles (69km).The SkyProwler is controlled using a radio remote control unit that comes with a live-streaming video screen.Users also have the option of removing the GPS module from the drone, and carrying it with them so that it acts as a homing beacon.According to Krossblade, flight time ranges from 24 minutes when it is in quadcopter mode to 40 minutes when flying fixed-wing. Pictured are the craft's key featuresA ready-to-fly package is currently being advertised on Kickstarter for $899. Shipping is estimated for July, if the Kickstarter is able to raise enough funds.The SkyProwler is based on the larger concept of the SkyCruiser transforming vehicle, which was unveiled last year.In normal flight, the SkyCruiser uses two 150 bhp electric motors in the tail, but when switching from horizontal to vertical flight, a set of four 'switchblade' rotor arms fold out from the fuselage to take the load.The SkyProwler is based on the larger concept of the SkyCruiser vehicle (pictured), which was unveiled last year. In normal flight, the SkyCruiser uses two 150 bhp electric motors in the tail, but when switching from horizontal to vertical flight, a set of four 'switchblade' rotor arms fold out from the fuselage to take the loadThere are four 80 bhp electric motors running the four main rotors, plus another four 10 bhp rotors to providing stability in crosswinds.According to Krossblade, the smaller rotors can accelerate faster than the larger ones, so they can respond faster to sudden gusts.On the ground, the 9.5 m (31 ft) wing span can be stowed away, and electric motors mounted in the wheels drive the craft along at 75 mph (112 kph) - although be warned, it is 8.4 m (27.5 ft) long.
