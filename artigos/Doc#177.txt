England vs Pakistan fourth Test day one scorecard: Keep up to date with the score as Alastair Cook and Co look to secure a series victory



England can take a giant leap towards becoming the No 1 side in Test cricket if they beat Pakistan in the final Test at the Oval, starting on Thursday.Alastair Cook's men are 2-1 up in the four-match series after securing an emphatic 141- run win in the third Test at Edgbaston on Sunday.But Pakistan will be determined to hit back after letting a first-innings lead of over 100 slip in Birmingham.The tourists have made two changes, with the hapless Mohammad Hafeez missing out and the injured Rahat Ali also replaced.In their place come in spinning all-rounder Iftikhar Ahmed for his first Test of the series, and experienced left-arm seamer Wahab Riaz.England are unchanged, turning down the chance to play Adil Rashid on an Oval pitch that, this season at least, has taken spin.And Alastair Cook took that turn into consideration at the toss, electing to bat despite the grass on the wicket and the clouds in the sky.Keep up to date with the score here, or follow all the action live with Sportsmail's team of reporters.
