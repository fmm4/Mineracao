Who does the housework in YOUR home? New study claims men around the world are now doing more of the cleaning



As countries around the world catch on to a more progressive mindset, the expected roles of men and women have begun to even out – especially when it comes to chores around the house.Over roughly the last 50 years, women in 19 countries were still found to spend an average of two hours more doing housework each day than men, according to a new study.But during this time, men’s overall share of the work has increased rapidly, with men even in some of the more ‘traditional’ countries found to take on a higher share of domestic tasks as of the early 2000s.As countries around the world catch on to a more progressive mindset, the expected roles of men and women have begun to even out – especially when it comes to chores around the house.

This is illustrated in the stock image aboveIn Norway, Finland, and Denmark, women were found to do just over an hour more housework than men.Some countries, however, are still struggling to catch on.While men in the US, Canada, Australia, Finland, and the Netherlands have been found to do more housework over the past few decades, these counties have experienced ‘stalls’ in the trend.This was primarily seen during the 1980s, the researchers, say, with another stall in the US during the 1990s.‘The overall picture is of a continuing move towards men and women sharing the housework more equally,’ says study co-author Oriel Sullivan, Professor of Sociology of Gender and Co-Director of the Centre for Time Use Research at the University of Oxford.The researchers say Nordic countries are the leaders in gender equality. In Norway, Finland, and Denmark, women were found to do just over an hour more housework than men.
