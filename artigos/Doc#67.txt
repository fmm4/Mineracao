Nasa is working on a Star Trek-style TRACTOR BEAM: System could capture objects in space using light



They helped the crew of the USS Enterprise in a number of sticky situations in Star Trek and enabled the Empire capture the elusive Millennium Falcon in Star Wars.Now researchers have revealed they are working with Nasa to develop real life tractor beams that could be used in space.Physicists say they are close to showing it is possible to capture, hold, push and pull objects using beams of light over distances of up to 0.4 inches (1cm).Scroll down for videoNasa is working with physicists to develop tractor beams that may be able to capture small particles such as comet dust while in space. It raises hopes that it may one day be possible to realise similar technology capable of capturing larger objects too like in Star Trek (pictured)They say if they can do that it may also be possible to move particles over several feet or even miles.While the objects they can move are still small – glass beads just a fraction of a millimetre across or about the same size as a human cell – the technology could be used to take samples while in orbit.Dr David Grier, a physicist at New York University who has been leading the project, said they were now working with researchers at Nasa's Goddard Space Centre in Maryland to develop long range tractor beams that can work over several miles.He said: 'It is like science fiction being made real.'A lot of people will be familiar with the idea that a wave can push. It is possible to structure a wave so that it doesn't just push, but it can grab onto an object, hold onto it and even pull it.'When we were first making tractor beams in the lab at first all we could do was move really tiny things over very, very small distances – just over a millionth of a meter.'We are not lifting up an entire battle cruiser and hauling it across space. But then once you have got to cm and to metres the next step is km. That is what we are working towards now.'In space exploration, this would be a very big deal.'Dr Grier and his colleagues first developed what they called Holographic Optical Tweezers back in 1997 to move small objects around but have since developed it further so they can pull and move objects.They do this by bouncing a laser off a projector to produce computer-generated holograms that resembles a spiral of intense light known as a solenoid beam.This corkscrew resembles an Archimedes' screw that can attract particles and by altering the hologram these can be moved along the corkscrew.Dr Grier said: 'This helical structure is what enables the beams to pull.'However, the size of the object is limited by the wavelength of the laser being used and its power.Speaking to the MailOnline, Dr Grier said even with small particle sizes they can currently move, the technology could have practical uses.He said: 'For instance, this is the size scale of the dust particles that cometary missions have been collecting from comet tails, and of the soot particles in automotive and industrial exhaust gases.The researchers have been able to create tractor beams with lasers (pictured) that generate holograms capable of capturing, pushing and pulling small particles. It could eventually be used to capture samples from passing comets in space or fumes from car exhaussts'In space there's no air resistance, so even a small force can have a big effect.'What our collaborators at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center would like to do is to outfit cometary and planetary exploration vehicles with tractor beams that will collect samples from a safe distance.'A tractor beam mounted on the International Space Station, for example, could continuously collect the dust particles and microscopic ice crystals in orbit around the earth.'These particles were deposited by passing comets, and carry within them the history of our solar system. Tractor beams would greatly simplify collecting these valuable samples for analysis.'Dr Grier is due to describe his technology in a documentary filmed by the Smithsonian to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the original Star Trek series.He said the technology could have uses on Earth too.They could be used to take samples of toxic fumes from a long distance for example and to examine the smoke from factories to see if they contain particles of pollution.He said: 'I am a star trek fan so I can't help seeing analogies between what they were dreaming of in the 1960s and what we are finally what we are able to do in the laboratory.'You have to realise Star Trek was supposed to be in the 23rd Century so we are a couple of years ahead. We are doing pretty well.'
