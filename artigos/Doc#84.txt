500 years on, meet the ship's carpenter from the Mary Rose! Face of sailor who died on the doomed Tudor vessel is revealed



This artist's impression shows a powerfully-built sailor believed to be the Mary Rose's carpenterAlmost 500 years after she sank, the Mary Rose is still giving up her secrets.This artist's impression shows a powerfully-built sailor believed to be the ship's carpenter – a man in his mid to late 30s, who was around 5ft 8in tall and died below deck.But the identities of hundreds of other drowned sailors remain a mystery, which British scientists hope to solve with help from international academics.By assembling bones retrieved from the depths of the Solent, they already know the carpenter's teeth were rotten, with a major abscess, and he had arthritis and skull pitting suggesting scurvy.His remains were found in a cabin used to store cable, he wore a tool belt, and the remains of a dog, a brown Jack Russell cross experts nicknamed Hatch, were discovered nearby.Examination of his skull was used to create an image of a man with a broad face, deep-set eyes, thin lips and a boxer's nose.While he is depicted with light brown hair and blue eyes, only DNA analysis would confirm this.And by photographing and scanning thousands of other unidentified bones, experts hope to piece together whole skeletons by putting them online.While much has been learnt about Henry VIII's favourite ship since she was raised in 1982, the remains of many – including the captain, navigator, boatswain and surgeon – are still unidentified.Launched in 1511, the Mary Rose was the Tudor king's flagship for 34 years before she sank off Portsmouth in a battle with the French in 1545. Around 500 men were aboard and just 35 survived.During excavation, some 10,000 bones belonging to more than 400 crew were recovered from the seabed.Launched in 1511, the Mary Rose (pictured) was the Tudor king's flagship for 34 years before she sank off Portsmouth in a battle with the French in 1545Some 92 skeletons have been partly assembled, including those of the carpenter, a gunner, purser and cook, plus several archers and officers.But the bones are delicate and the work is complex, time-consuming and relies on a lot of luck.Making them available to academics around the world via a password-protected website could vastly speed up the process, the British Science Festival in Swansea will hear this week.Swansea University experts and the Mary Rose Trust have already put detailed images of ten skulls online.The 3D images, created by stitching together hundreds of high-resolution photos, can be twisted and turned, magnified and shrunk.By assembling bones (pictured) retrieved from the depths of the Solent, they already know the carpenter's teeth were rotten, with a major abscess, and he had arthritis and skull pitting suggesting scurvyThe Virtual Tudors site, launched today, also has a public section featuring the carpenter's skull.Alex Hildred, head of research at the trust, said: 'Excavating the cabin was like stepping into a deserted workshop. There were things hanging up tucked between frames, like a grandfather's shed.'Some of the carpenter's tools are also on display online and at the Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth.Dr Hildred added: 'If we can make that assemblage accessible in a number of ways, then we are engaging more people than we can just in the museum.'Find out more by visiting www.virtualtudors.org
