Have scientists spotted a new particle? Researchers claim 'Madala boson' could help explain dark matter



Physicists have predicted the existence of a new fundamental particle that could help to solve the mystery of dark matter.Known as the ‘Madala boson,’ the newly proposed particle has many similarities to the Higgs boson – but unlike the latter, it’s thought to interact with the elusive dark matter which makes up roughly 27 percent of the universe.The researchers in South Africa analyzed data from multiple experiments conducted at the Large Hadron Collider, and found that key features and peculiarities associated with the Madala hypothesis corroborated across the reports.Known as the ‘Madala boson,’ the newly proposed particle shares many similarities with the Higgs boson – but unlike the latter, it’s thought to interact with the elusive dark matter which makes up roughly 27 percent of the universe.

Sometimes we also just call it the 'X boson,' where 'X' means unknown.'However, they admit further experiments are crucial.
