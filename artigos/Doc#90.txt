Is this the real Nessie? Fossil of 170 million-year-old sea monster found at Scottish loch is freed from its rocky tomb



The legendary monster prowling the dark waters of Loch Ness is one of Scotland's most enduring mysteries.Yet it appears Loch Ness is not the only highland loch to perhaps have been home to giant predators from a prehistoric age.A fossilised skeleton of a marine reptile that ruled the seas 170 million years ago has finally been unveiled nearly half a century after it was discovered on the Isle of Skye.A fossil of a predator (pictured) that prowled the ocean 170 million years ago have been freed from the rock that encased it 50 years after being found on the beach of a loch on the Isle of Skye. the ichthyosaur would have measured up to 13 feet long and hunted fishThe creature, which would have been around 13 feet (4m) long, is a type of ichthyosaur – a large marine reptile that looked a little like a primitive type of dolphin.In fact these sea-monsters were reptiles and had mouths filled with hundreds of cone-shaped teeth that let it snatch fish and squid from the water.The fossil, which has spent 50 years entombed within the rock it was found in close to Storr Loch Power Station on Skye, is the most complete ichthyosaur ever found in Scotland.Palaeontologists at the University of Edinburgh worked with experts at the National Museums Scotland to extract it from the stone it was encased within.In order to remove the hard rock surrounding the fossil, conservators used a vibrating needle made out of hard steel to carefully free the remains.Dr Steve Brusatte, a palaeontologist at the University of Edinburgh, said: 'Ichthyosaurs like the Storr Lochs monster ruled the waves while dinosaurs thundered across the land.'Their bones are exceptionally rare in Scotland, which makes this specimen one of the crown jewels of Scottish fossils.'It's all thanks to the keen eye of an amateur collector that this remarkable fossil was ever found in the first place, which goes to show that you don't need an advanced degree to make huge scientific discoveries.'Skye is one of the few places where fossils from the middle Jurassic period can be found.The Storr Lochs Monster was found on a beach near the Storr Lochs Power Station in 1966 by Norrie Gillies, who was the faciliites manager.Ichthyosaurs (artist's impression) were powerful marine reptiles with mouth's filled with cone-shaped teeth. They thrived during the Jurassic at a time when dinosaurs rule the landThe fossil ichthyosaur was found on the beach beside Storr Lochs Power Station on the Isle of Skye on the west coast of Scotland (shown on map)The fossil was put into safe keeping at the National Museums Scotland's storage facility for 50 years as scientists lacked the technology needed to free it from the dense rock.However, researchers have now carefully chipped this away and are now preparing to carry out a detailed examination of the fossil.Sadly Mr Gillies died in 2011 at the age of 93-years-old and never got to see his fossil in all its glory.The fossil was found encased in hard, compacted rock (pictured), but palaeotologists have now been working to free the fossilised remains from this so it can be studiedThe fossil was found in 1966 on the beach of the Storr Loch Power Station by Norris Gillies, who ran the facility. His son Allan (pictured) was six at the time when it was foundDr Nick Fraser, keeper of natural sciences at National Museums Scotland, said: 'The Storr Lochs monster highlights the rich fossil heritage of Skye.'Collaborations between scientists at National Museums Scotland, the University of Edinburgh and elsewhere in the UK are beginning to shed new light on the middle Jurassic of Skye - a time when dinosaurs were dominant on land but mammals were also diversifying.'Nicknamed the Storr Lochs Monster, some have speculated that it could be an ancestor of the Loch Ness Monster that is supposed to stalk the depths of Loch Ness about 90 miles to the east.Scientists say the fossil (pictured) is the 'crown jewel' of those found so far in Scotland from the Jurassic Period, when much of the country lay beneath a shallow but warm seaThe fossilised ichthyosaur was unveiled at the National Museums Scotland (pictured left with the remains of an Ice Age giant deer) where it has lain in its storage facility for nearly 50 years. Scientists will now examine the fossil in more detail in a new research project (right)Some monster-hunters have speculated that Nessie could be a descendant of ancient predators like ichthyosaurs or the earlier plesiosaurs that thrived during the Jurassic period.Yet despite decades of searching, scientists have yet to find any hard evidence that such a monster still lives in the deep sea loch.By comparison the Storr Lochs Monsters really did prowl the seas over what is now one of Scotland's most dramatic landscapes.Martin Pibworth, managing director wholesale at SSE, said: 'The fossil was found 50 years ago by Norrie Gillies who, like his son Allan, are both proud SSE company men and were determined it should receive the public attention it deserves.'SSE hopes this fossil will indeed prove to be a 'crown jewel' in Scotland's Jurassic history and thanks to the foresight of the Gillies family, enjoyed by generations to come.'Some have speculated that the monster rumoured to prowl the depths of Loch Ness could be a descendant of creatures like the prehistoric ichthyosaur found at Storr Lochs.
