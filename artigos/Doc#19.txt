Would you pay £450 for this? Alcatel launches a smartphone-free VR headset to compete with Oculus



Chinese smartphone firm Alcatel has launched a virtual reality headset that works without a smartphone.While rivals like the Samsung Gear VR require a mobile phone and the HTC Vive is designed to work with a computer, the Alcatel Vision is completely independent.Alcatel's device features built-in smartphone hardware, including an eight-core processor, 3GB of RAM and 32GB of storage along with Bluetooth and LTE connectivity.The Alcatel Vision headset is much bulkier than many of its rivals because it works independently of a smartphone so all of the processing technology is built inThe headset also packs a range of sensors including an accelorometer and proximity sensor.Instead of relying on a smartphone screen, the Vision is equipped with a pair of tiny 3.8-inch AMOLED screens with a 1,080 x 1,200-pixel resolution.'It can be worn comfortably for 2-3 hours, with or without glasses, allowing plenty of time for a child to take a VR tour of a museum or for watching a movie,' said Alcatel in a statement.The 3,000 mAH battery is located on a pad that fits around the back of the head, making the design decidedly chunky.The Vision will be available in China by the end of the year and is expected to land in the US in early 2017, though a UK launch date has yet to be confirmed.The company also introduced the Alcatel 360 - a 360-degree video camera available in two versions, a rectangular model, about half the size of a credit card, and a ball-shaped one, about the size of a coin.'VR is the next big computing platform and will reshape the way we experience the world,' said Nicolas Zibell General Manager of International Business and President of Alcatel parent company TCL Communication.'That's why we're jumping in feet first. Our new mobile VR device and 360-degree camera are for those who believe that technology can change the world - and they want to be part of that change.'Alcatel also unveiled two 360-video cameras to coincide with the launch of its virtual reality headset Vision headsetHowever, the rumoured £450 ($600) price tag could put potential buyers off.Users can get a Samsung Gear VR headset, plus a compatible phone, for a similar price.Those on a budget can already use cheap smartphone-based VR headsets such as the Google Cardboard, while those who want a more sophisticated product may lean towards established brands like Oculus.The Facebook-owned firm recently warned Samsung Galaxy Note 7 owners not to use the device with the Gear VR headset, which is made by Oculus.The Note 7 was recalled by Samsung following reports of the oversized smartphone's batteries exploding.Oculus urged users to wait for their replacement device before trying it out with the headset.
