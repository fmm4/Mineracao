Forget self-driving, try self-SAILING! Robotic boat can scour the oceans for data without the need for sailors



Two self-sailing ships have been travelling across the Bering Sea, off the coast of Alaska.The boats are operated by Saildrone, a company that is creating robotic sailboats that can travel without sailors for up to eight months.These autonomous vessels can collect details on water temperature, salinity and ecosystem information that would be difficult and expensive to collect by person.Scroll down for videoSaildrone is a company creating robotic self-driving sailboats that can travel without sailors for up to eight months. The boats can collect details on, water temperature, salinity and ecosystem information that would be difficult and expensive to collect by personThe Saildrone boats have been used by scientists and engineers from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to collect valuable information about the Alaskan coast.The boats look like miniature yachts, with carbon-fibre sails and a distinctive orange design.Operating by solar and wind power, the vessels can carry 200 pounds of instruments.They are controlled through communications satellites from an operations centre, meaning no on-board sailors are needed.In June, two boats were deployed carrying acoustic equipment that can pick up the sounds of North Pacific right whales, one on the most endangered animals on the planet.Doug DeMaster, science director at the Alaska Fisheries Science Centre, said: 'The Saildrone should provide us a much more efficient, cost effective way to at least try to identify areas and times of year where we're hearing right whales, and then we could reliably design surveys to take advantage of that information.'As well as counting whales, the boats could be used for weather prediction, oil and gas industry operations, or even to police illegal fishing.The boats look like miniature yachts, with carbon-fibre sails and a distinctive orange design.

'I think the limit is going to be marine growth, rather than fatigue or failure. You just can't stop the weed growing on the vehicle.'The boats come at a price, and scientists, commercial fisherman and weather predictors pay a $2,500 (£1,875) a day fee per boat for the data they produce.So far, the longest mission has been eight months and 10,000 miles.
