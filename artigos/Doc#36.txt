Women are just as pushy as men when asking for a pay rise - but male employees are more likely to get one



The idea that women get paid lower salaries than their male counterparts because they are less willing to ask for a raise is a myth, claims a new report.Women ask for pay rises just as often as men, but men are 25 per cent more likely to get them, according to the research.In the study carried out by an international team of researchers, men were able to secure a pay increase 20 per cent of the time, while women were only successful 16 per cent of the time.Women ask for pay rises just as often as men, but men are 25 per cent more likely to get them, according to the research (stock image)'We didn't know how the numbers would come out,' said study co-author Andrew Oswald, Professor of Economics and Behavioural Science at the University of Warwick.'Having seen these findings, I think we have to accept that there is some element of pure discrimination against women,' he added.The researchers investigated claims that female employees tend to be reluctant to ask for wage increases as they don't want to deviate from a perceived female stereotype or risk upsetting their boss.The study found nothing to suggest that the theories were true.Co-author Dr Amanda Goodall from Cass Business School at the University of London said: 'Ours is the first proper test of the reticent-female theory, and the evidence doesn't stand up.'The researcher focused on a randomly chosen sample of 4.600 workers across more than 800 employers.This is the first comprehensive study to include a statistical test of the idea that women get paid less because they are not as pushy as men in the workplace, say the researchers.The study was based on data gathered as part of the Australian Workplace Relations Survey (AWRS) in 2013-2104.'We realised that Australia was the natural test bed, because it is the only country in the world to collect systematic information on whether employees have asked for a rise,' said Professor Oswald.Encouragingly, young female employees - under the age of 40 - were found to get pay rises just as often as young male colleaguesThe in-depth survey asked each worker a wide range of questions about their salary including whether their pay was set by negotiation with their employer and whether they had successfully secured a pay rise since joining the company.The data also quizzed the workers on whether they avoided asking for a pay rise because they were concerned about their working relationships, why they decided that and also about their levels of job satisfaction.The statistical analysis took several factors into account including the nature of the employer, the industry and the qualifications of the works, as well as they number of hours they worked.While the results showed that women are less successful at securing pay rises, despite asking just as much as men, there was some more encouraging news.Young female employees - under the age of 40 - were found to get pay rises just as often as young male colleagues.'This study potentially has an upside. Young women today are negotiating their pay and conditions more successfully than older females, and perhaps that will continue as they become more senior', said Dr Goodall said.
