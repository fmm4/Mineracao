The Enigma machine goes quantum: Groundbreaking unbreakable encryption system revealed



It has been dubbed the ‘quantum enigma machine’ - and has been used for a groundbreaking new form of unbreakable encrypted messaging for the first time.The researchers proved a message could be sent with a key that’s shorter than the message itself, breaking the conditions defined decades ago by the ‘father of information theory,’ Claude Shannon.This encryption method, known as quantum data locking, could one day make for super-secure systems in which it is virtually impossible for a third party to obtain and translate the message.Using a device dubbed the ‘quantum enigma machine,’ researchers have demonstrated a new form of unbreakable encrypted messaging for the first time. In an example explaining how this system works, a hypothetical ‘Alice’ is sending an encrypted message to ‘Bob,’ with ‘Eve’ being the third partyThe researchers from the University of Rochester describe the device which has made this method possible in a paper published in the journal Physical Review A.Called the quantum enigma machine, it is named for the encryption devices used by Germany during World War II.Unbreakable encrypted messages currently rely on three conditions established by Claude Shannon: the key is random, used only once, and is at least as long as the message itself.But, recent advancements have highlighted ways to develop secure encryption systems with quantum data locking, which uses photons to carry messages.Explained in a 2013 paper by Seth Lloyd, a professor of quantum information at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, photon waves can be altered in many more ways than binary systems.Among the possibilities, the angle of tilt can be changed, wavelength can be adjusted, and the size of amplitude can be modified.Based on these properties, the researcher proposed that the quantum key can be shorter than the message itself.The new device developed by the University of Rochester researchers puts this theory to work, ultimately aiming to prevent a third party from gaining access to – and translating – an encrypted message.In an example explaining how this system works, a hypothetical ‘Alice’ is sending an encrypted message to ‘Bob,’ with ‘Eve’ being the third party.Alice uses the machine to generate photons, which move through space and into a spatial light modulator (SLM) that alters the properties of each individual photon.Doing this allows the message to be encoded in a way that can be focused to unique points, while also distorting the shapes of the photons into random patterns.Both Alice and Bob known the keys, so Bob can use his SLM to translate the altered properties back into distinct elements of the message.This encryption method, known as quantum data locking, could one day make for super-secure systems in which it is virtually impossible for a third party to obtain and translate the messageBut without the keys, Eve could not do this.The work also taps into the fundamental uncertainty of quantum measurements, which states that the more we know about one property of a particle, the less we know about another.Based on this, six bits of classical information were securely locked using just one bit of an encryption key.The work marks a huge step in both encryption and quantum data locking.‘While our device is not 100 percent secure, due to photon loss, it does show that data locking in message encryption is far more than a theory,’ says Daniel Lum, a graduate student in physics.Researchers in China have simultaneously published a paper on the topic.‘It’s highly unlikely that our free-space implementation will be useful through atmospheric conditions,' Lum says.‘Instead, we have identified the use of optic fiber as a more practical route for data locking, a path Pan’s group actually started with. Regardless, the field is still in its infancy with a great deal more research needed.’
