Wrap up warm! Climate change is causing extreme weather winters to become far more common in the US



Over the past few decades, the United States has seen a dramatic rise in the number of extreme wintertime temperature events – and at opposite ends of the country, these events appear to be connected.While the East has experienced colder days, researchers have noted the simultaneous occurrence of extremely warm days in the West.According to a new study, the ‘warm West, cold East’ temperature gap is steadily expanding, and is likely being driven by human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.Over the past few decades, the United States has seen a dramatic rise in wintertime temperature extremes. While the East has experienced colder days, researchers have noted the simultaneous occurrence of extremely warm days in the West.

But, they say extremely cold events are still likely happen‘Although the occurrence of cold extremes is often used as evidence to dismiss the existence of human-caused global warming, our work shows that the warm West, cool East trend is actually consistent with the influence of human activities that have modified Earth’s climate in recent decades,’ Singh said.If global warming persists, the researchers say the occurrence of these simultaneous events will likely decrease, as both the East and West are expected to become hotter during the winter overall.But, they say extremely cold events are still likely happen even as global temperatures rise.‘We can absolutely expect further increases in hot events if global warming continues,’ Diffenbaugh said.‘But our results also highlight how complex climate change can be. We should be prepared for both warm and cold extremes – sometimes simultaneously – now and in the future.’
