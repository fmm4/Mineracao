Global warming in 167 maps: Climate scientist reveals chilling artwork showing how the planet has warmed since 1850



Climate change has become one of the most hotly debated topics in recent years, but in a powerful new visualization, a climate scientist lets the evidence speak for itself.Ed Hawkins, creator of the viral ‘spiral global temperatures’ animation, has now mapped global temperature changes dating back to 1850, presenting a side-by-side view of the yearly anomalies.This simple presentation reveals the stark reality of our warming planet, showing an overall trend of rising temperatures that has accelerated in recent decades.Scroll down for videoEd Hawkins, creator of the viral ‘spiral global temperatures’ animation, has now mapped global temperature changes dating back to 1850, presenting a side-by-side view of the yearly anomaliesThe visualization created by the University of Reading climate scientist complies 167 maps, plotting every year from 1850 to 2016 using the HadCRUT4.4 dataset from the Met Office Hadley Centre.The data show global historical surface temperature anomalies relative to a 1961-1990 baseline, with a colour scale of roughly -2.5C to + 2.5C.In the maps, blue indicates cooler temperatures while red shows warmth. Those without enough data are coloured grey.‘The visualisation technique of ‘small multiples’ is often used to communicate a simple message,’ Hawkins wrote in a post for Climate Lab Book.And, the message in this case is clear – over the years, surface temperatures risen dramatically, especially since the 1990s.In the maps, blue indicates cooler temperatures while red shows warmth, and, those without enough data are coloured greyThis isn’t the first time Hawkins has highlighted climate change through a unique visualization.In May, the climate scientist revealed the ‘Spiralling global temperatures’ animation, which shows how global temperatures have changed month-by-month between 1850 and 2016.A similar animation even made an appearance at the Rio Olympics opening ceremony.In the graphic, the global temperature change remains relatively small until the 1930s, but starts growing slowly after that.The animation shows how global temperatures have changed month-to-month since 1850When the GIF reaches the late 1990s, however, the temperature change increases considerably.Speaking to MailOnline in May, Dr Ed Hawkins said, 'I wanted to try to visualise the global changes we have seen in different ways to learn about how we might improve our communication.'The pace of change is immediately obvious, especially over the past few decades, and the relationship between current global temperatures and the internationally discussed limits are also clear.'An animation created by climate scientist Ed Hawkins has revealed how global temperatures have increased by year on year since 1850. It shows the global temperature change until 2016 (pictured)Dr Hawkins used data from the UK Met Office’s Hadley Centre and the University of East Anglia’s Climatic Research Centre. The graph above shows a more traditional representation of the dataWithin the animation it is also possible to see how global events such as the El Nino phenomenon alter temperatures around the world.For example, there is a small amount of cooling between the 1880s and 1910 due to volcanic eruptions before warming again between 1910 and the 1940s.Dr Hawkins said this warming was due to a small increase in solar output and natural variability and recovery from the volcanic eruptions.Temperatures also remain largely flat between the 1950s and the 1970s, he explained in his blog, because aerosols released into the atmosphere mask the impact of greenhouse gases.But from 1980 there is strong warming with temperatures pushed particularly high in 1998 and 2016 due to strong El Nino events.The researcher cautions that this technique is not meant to suggest the downfall of our planet, but instead to spur efforts toward reversing the human-induced damage.Dr Hawkins said: 'Some have used the graphic to suggest that temperatures are "spiralling out of control", but I disagree - human activities are largely responsible for past warming so we do have control over what happens next.'
