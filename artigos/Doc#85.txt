Giant pandas are no longer endangered: Global watchdog downgrades the bears to 'vulnerable'



It may be the poster animal for endangered species awareness, but it appears the giant panda has bounced back.The black and white bear, a symbol of China, has finally been shifted off the endangered species list after years of intensive conservation efforts.The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) said in a report released on Sunday that the animal is now classified as a 'vulnerable' instead of 'endangered' species, reflecting its growing numbers in the wild in southern China.Scroll down for videoConservation experts say the giant panda (pictured) is no longer endangered in the wild. The downgrade in risk status follows decades of intensive conservation efforts to boost numbers of the wild bears in southern ChinaIt said the wild panda population jumped to 1,864 in 2014 from 1,596 in 2004, the result of work by Chinese agencies to enforce poaching bans and expand forest reserves.The IUCN report warned that although better forest protection has helped increase panda numbers, climate change is predicted to eliminate more than 35 per cent of its natural bamboo habitat in the next 80 years, potentially leading to another decline.Animal groups hailed the recovery of the bamboo-munching, black-and-white bear that has long been a symbol of China and the global conservation movement.The panda population reached an estimated low of less than 1,000 in the 1980s due to poaching and deforestation until Beijing threw its full weight behind preserving the animal.Intensive conservation efforts have helped the numbers of wild giant pandas to bounce back, downgrading the animals from 'endangered' to 'vulnerable'Scientists expect the giant panda's habitat and main source or food - bamboo forests - to shrink in the coming decades in response to the shifting climatePandas have been sent to zoos around the world as a gesture of Chinese diplomatic goodwill, with births in captivity seen as a cause for celebration.The Chinese government and the World Wildlife Fund first established the Wolong National Nature Reserve in Sichuan province in 1980.Wild panda numbers have slowly rebounded as China cracked down on the skin trade and gradually expanded its protected forest areas to now cover 1.4 million hectares (5,400 square miles).International groups and the Chinese government has worked to save wild pandas and breed them at enormous cost, attracting criticism that money could be better spent saving other animals facing extinction.But the WWF, whose logo has been a panda since 1961, celebrated the panda's re-classification, saying it proved that aggressive investment does pay off 'when science, political will and engagement of local communities come together.'China's State Forestry Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
