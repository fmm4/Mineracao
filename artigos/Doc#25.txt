Did China lose a spy satellite in a SpaceX-style launch failure? Reports suggest government cover up



September has not been a good month for launching satellites.Reports have emerged that the Chinese government may be covering up a failed rocket launch which resulted in the loss of a cutting edge spy satellite.The rocket, which launched from Shanxi on Thursday, is thought to have failed to get its cargo – an advanced earth observation satellite – into orbit.There are social media reports of a police search carried out to find debris strewn across the neighbouring Shaanxi province.The reports follow in the wake of last week’s SpaceX disaster, in which Elon Musk’s firm lost an Israeli communications satellite when its Falcon 9 rocket exploded on the launch pad.Scroll down for videoReports have emerged that the Chinese government may be covering up a failed rocket launch which resulted in the loss of a cutting edge spy satellite.

The Chinese people’s psychological endurance isn’t as fragile as you think.'Another added: 'Can the news media show some professionalism, or can the propaganda departments be more frank?'The reported loss of the Chinese Gaofen-10 satellite follows in the wake of a loss from SpaceX last week. The AMOS-6 satellite was aboard a Falcon 9 rocket which exploded during a test fire in Florida last week, destroying the rocket and its cargo (pictured left to right)China's space agency, a branch of the military, has historically been secretive about its missions and longer term goals.Earlier this year the Chinese space agency launched technology aimed at tackling the growing problem of space trash in orbit around the Earth, raising concerns the technology could be used to take out Western communications satellites if needed.The government has cited the safety record of its Long March rockets.This incident is the first failure since the loss of the CBERS 03 satellite, a joint venture between China and Brazil, which was lost after its carrier, a Chang Zheng rocket, failed in 2013.
