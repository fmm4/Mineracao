Madagascar 'ghost snake' found to be unique new species of cat-eyed reptile



After hiking more than 17 miles in the rain, researchers in Madagascar happened upon an elusive, pale grey snake with markings that had never been seen before.Though just one has been found so far, the team says the ‘ghost snake’ represents a new species of cat-eyed snake, earning its name based on its appearance and mysterious behaviour.The team had initially set out to find a different species altogether, but instead discovered this unique creature at the grey limestone ‘tsingy’ rocks at Ankarana Reserve.Researchers in Madagascar have discovered an elusive, pale grey snake with markings that had never been seen before. Though just one has been found so far, the team says the ‘ghost snake’ represents a new species of cat-eyed snakeCat-eyed snakes are one of the most common types of snakes in Madagascar and have vertical pupils.While they’re often found in developed areas and degraded forests, the species discovered at Ankarana National Park in February 2014 was far more isolated.This specimen is unlike any known cat-eyed snakes, the researchers explain in in a paper published today in the journal Copeia.‘None of the other snakes in Madagascarophis are as pale and none of them have this distinct pattern,’ said Sara Ruane, post-doctoral research at the LSU Museum of Natural Science and lead author of the paper.The researchers have given it the name Madagascarophis lolo, meaning ‘ghost’ in Malagasy, with its closest relative being the Madagascarophis fuschi.‘I think what’s exciting and important about this work is even though the cat-eyed snakes could be considered one of the most common groups of snakes in Madagascar, there are still new species we don’t know about because a lot of regions are hard to get to and poorly explored,’ Ruane says.‘If this commonly known, wide group of snakes harbors this hidden diversity, what else is out there that we don’t know about?’The ghost snake was spotted by Malagasy master’s student Bernard Randriamahatantsoa during a hike that had extended more than 17 miles in search of a different species.The team had initially set out to find a different species altogether, but instead discovered this unique creature at the grey limestone ‘tsingy’ rocks at Ankarana Reserve.

They are pretty elusive.’As a result of their elusive behaviour, researchers carry out much of their field work during Madagascar’s rainy season, when snakes and their prey are most active.The team then returned to the US to conduct morphological and genetic analyses, including the tedious work of counting all scales on the snake’s belly, back, those touching the eye, and those on the upper and lower lips.They also collected samples from the ghost snake and its close relative, the Madagascarophis fuschi, and compared three genetic markers across the genus to determine the new snake’s similarities to known species.According to Ruane, the ghost snake is now considered a species entirely of its own.‘All of the analyses we did supported that this is a distinct species,' the researcher says, 'despite the fact that we only have this one individual.
