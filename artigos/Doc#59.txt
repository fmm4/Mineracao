White House unveils stunning interactive 3D maps of Alaska in bid to better track climate change in the Arctic



As climate change poses an ongoing threat to the global ecosystem, few areas are being affected as rapidly or severely as the Arctic - which is is warming at double the rate of the global average temperature.In efforts to track these changes and mitigate the risks they present, a White House-backed project plans to create satellite-based elevation maps of the entire Arctic by 2017.Today, the first maps showing Alaska's terrain were released.Scroll down to see the interactive version of the mapIn efforts to track the effects of climate change, researchers have launched a collaborative effort to create satellite-based elevation maps of the entire Arctic by 2017. The first series of maps reveals the terrain of Alaska in unprecedented detail. Wolverine Glacier, pictured, is a valley glacier in the mountains of south-central Alaska's Kenai PeninsulaThe project is the result of an Executive Order made by President Obama last year, and now, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and the National Science Foundation have completed a major step toward this goal, revealing a stunning new series of 3D maps plotting Alaska’s terrain.The Arctic Digital Elevation Models (Arctic DEMs) are all publicly available through an online portal, according to the White House’s official blog.Visualizations of this kind can help to track sea level changes and monitor coastal erosion to help develop effective strategies as climate change worsens the effects of storms.As Arctic warms and ice subsequently shrinks, open water will gain more area, putting coastal communities at risk.Use your mouse to navigate this interactive version of the mapThe models were created using 2-meter resolution images from Digital Globe commercial satellites, providing an unprecedented glimpse at inhospitable and remote areas of the Arctic.The new maps revealed by the White House show numerous locations across Alaska, including Kodiak Benny Benson State Airport, Wolverine Glacier, Anchorage, and Mount Aniakchak.While the project is led by the NGA and NSF, many other organizations are involved as well, including the U.S. Geological Survey, the state of Alaska, Ohio State University, University of Illinois, Cornell University, the Polar Geospatial Center at the University of Minnesota, and ESRI.The map above focuses on Kodiak Benny Benson State Airport. The image highlights the rugged relief surrounding the three runways of the airport and clearly depicts vegetation, buildings, coastal features and the drainage network of the area. Blue indicates low elevations while green shows medium to higher elevations, with red revealing peaksThis map shows Mount Aniakchak, a volcanic caldera located in the Aniakchak National Monument and Preserve in the Aleutian Range of Alaska. Aniakchak is one of the wildest and least visited places in the National Park System‘For the United States, the Arctic is simultaneously a strategic challenge and a human challenge,’ said Dr. Fabien Laurier, Senior Policy Advisory, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy.‘These maps will allow all of our Arctic stakeholders, ranging from Native and Tribal, state and local, the Federal family, our international partners and the business community, to develop the best responses to the changing Arctic.’The researchers say these types of maps can be produced regularly for weekly, monthly, or annual updates on the changing terrain, thanks to satellite capabilities.The maps show the city of Kotzebue, which President Obama visited a year ago. Kotzebue is located in the Northwest Arctic Borough right above the Arctic CircleThe Seward Peninsula is pictured. ‘If another country threatened to wipe out an American town, we’d do everything in our power to protect it,’ President Obama said during his visit to the town of Kotzebue. ‘Well, climate change poses the same threat right now. And that’s why I care so deeply about this’‘This technology and resulting contributions are game changers for the Arctic region,’ said Robert Cardillo, Director, NGA.‘Traditionally, our capabilities for imagery collection were limited to the availability and frequency of low flying aircraft.‘With this renewed effort involving the US government, universities, and the commercial imagery and scientific communities, the possibilities for understanding this part of the world are practically limitless.’The map above illustrates Anchorage Alaska based on new elevation data. The researchers say these types of maps can be produced regularly for weekly, monthly, or annual updates on the changing terrain, thanks to satellite capabilities.
