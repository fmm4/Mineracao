England vs Pakistan second one-day international scorecard: Keep up to date with all the action from Lord's



England face Pakistan in their second one-day international clash at Lord's on Saturday looking to build on their impressive opening victory in Southampton.Eoin Morgan's side won a rain-hit encounter at the Ageas Bowl by 44 runs on the Duckworth–Lewis method on Wednesday, with Jason Roy and Joe Root among the runs before the wet weather set in.Pakistan, in truth, looked well short of England in all aspects in the first game but after some harsh words from their head coach Mickey Arthur, Azhar Ali and his team will have something to prove in the capital.‘I want to see the guys go out and express themselves,’ said Arthur.‘Playing the way we played the other night, we’re behind the times.'The invitation is there to every player: step up or we’ll find somebody else who can step up. It’s as simple as that.’While Pakistan question their approach, England are in a pretty good state.Roy and Root led the way in Southampton with the bat while Chris Woakes continued his impressive summer with the ball with another economical spell.Trevor Bayliss has helped rejuvenate England's white-ball cricket and Morgan's team will be short-priced favourites for another win in the capital.Anything other than a home series win - following the shared Test series - would be considered a massive shock.England are unsurprisingly unchanged while Pakistan made three switches with spinner Yasir Shah returning to the side.England XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan (c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Mark WoodPakistan XI: Sami Aslam, Sharjeel Khan, Azhar Ali (c), Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed, Imad Wasim, Yasir Shah, Wahab Riaz, Hassan Ali, Muhammad Amir.
