Forget having a sixth sense, now there may be a sixth TASTE - and it could reveal why we love carbs so much



It has long been thought that there are four primary tastes – salty, sweet, sour and bitter, although a fifth taste, called Umami, was added as a fifth in 2009.But researchers suggest that there may be a sixth taste missing from the list.They say that complex carbohydrates, such as starch, have their own taste and should be considered an independent flavour.Researchers suggest that there may be a sixth taste missing from the list. They say that complex carbohydrates, such as starch, have their own taste and should be considered an independent flavourThe research comes from scientists at Oregan State University, who wanted to understand how every culture used complex carbohydrates, yet they do not have their own taste.Complex carbohydrates are made of sugar molecules strung together, much like pearls on a necklace.They are a vital source of vitamins, minerals, and fibre, and are used by cultures worldwide.When complex carbohydrates are broken down by saliva, their chains break down into simple sugars, which were assumed to produce a sweet taste.However, the researchers suggested that this was not the case, and that the carbohydrates themselves had a unique flavour.To test their theory, the scientists gave a range of different carbohydrate solutions to volunteers and asked them what they thought the taste was.Dr Juyun Lim, who led the study, told New Scientist: 'They called the taste "starchy".'Asians would say it was rice-like, while Caucasians described it as bread-like or pasta-like. It's like eating flour.'The researchers then gave the participants a compound that blocks the receptors of the tongue that detect sweet tastes.Despite this, the participants could still make out the floury flavour.To test their theory, the scientists gave a range of different carbohydrate solutions to volunteers and asked them what they thought the taste was (stock image)This suggests that we can taste carbohydrates before they are broken down into sugar molecules, and have a flavour in their own right.The results suggest that human taste is more complex than previously thought.Dr Michael Tordoff, a psychobiologist at Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, who himself is trying to understand whether we can taste calcium, said: 'Many people think there are only five tastes, but a bunch of us think there might be others.'This is not the first time a sixth taste has been suggested.Last year, scientists from Purdue University in Indiana proposed that fats should have their own flavour, called 'oleogustus' because it evoked unique sensations.One criterion that is definitely met, is that a flavour must be useful to us – starch is a valuable source of slow-release energyTo become recognised as a primary taste, however, flavour must meet a strict list of criteria.This includes having their own set of tongue receptors, being recognisable, and triggering a physiological response.Unfortunately for the researchers, starch does not meet all the criteria – the researchers are yet to find tongue receptors.However, one criterion that is definitely met, is that a flavour must be useful to us – starch is a valuable source of slow-release energy.Dr Lim added: 'I believe that's why people prefer complex carbs.'Sugar tastes great in the short term, but if you're offered chocolate and bread, you might eat a small amount of the chocolate, but you'd choose the bread in larger amounts, or as a daily staple.'
