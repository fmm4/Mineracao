Why lowering your voice can win you a woman: Male mammals who use deeper mating calls are successful because it exaggerates their size



It is a common ploy by men looking to impress the opposite set, but puffing out your chest and lowering your voice may very well help you win more mates.Researchers have found many mammals have evolved ways of exaggerating their size by deepening their mating calls so they will be picked by females.But it seems humans could put this to better use as our voices are not as deep as might be expected in a species of our size, the researchers found.Males of many mammal species have evolved adaptations to make themselves bigger than they really are because it helps them win a mate. Research has shown that female red deer find deeper mating calls produced by stags (pictured) more attractive, for exampleThe findings suggest that men looking to win a mate could benefit by lowering the harmonic resonance in their voices, much like singer Barry White.Dr Benjamin Charlton, a zoologist at University College Dublin who led the research, said: 'It has been shown by other research that lower pitch and lower resonance frequencies in men's voices like Barry White are more attractive to women, particularly if they are ovulating.'They are also more intimidating to other men.'But while we can see humans do have descended larynges, which suggests the male voice has been subject to sexual selection and as been exaggerated, it is not as low as we might expect for a species of our size.'This suggests that our voices have been also altered by natural selection for facial adaptations related to speech.'The study, which is published in the journal Nature Communication, found many male mammals produce lower harmonic frequency calls than their body size suggests.Species like koala, fallow deer, howler monkeys and lions have all developed adaptations to achieve this.Dr Charlton, said: 'Large mammals tend to have larger vocal tracts and large larynges to allow them to produce lower resonance and lower frequency calls.'Some species possess anatomical innovations that enable males to produce abnormally low fundamental frequency.'We have shown that sexual selection pressures on males to be larger in order to attract a female has led some mammals to take this further to exaggerate their size.'The researchers found that many species that exaggerate their size in this way have developed descended vocal tracts or larynges.Others have evolved adaptations such as nasal proboscises or additional vocal folds to increase the resonance of their calls.Females in some species such as koalas and red deer have already been shown to find lower resonance mating calls by males to be more attractive.In humans, women are known to find deeper male voices more attractive in what has become called the Barry White effect (pictured). But the new research suggests that men do not have voices as deepMale koalas (pictured) produce deep haunting mating calls that are far lower in resonant frequency than would be expected for their size. Research, however, has shown that females find these lower calls more attractive and that this trait has been subject to sexual selectionThey also help to deter other males from competing by giving the impression that the animal producing the call is larger.The researchers examined the relationship between male vocal calls and body size in 72 terrestrial mammal species.They found that vocal exaggeration seems to have undergone sexual selection as an indicator of large male body size.Animals living in the trees, such as howler or colobus monkeys have developed particularly low calls for their size, perhaps because low frequency sounds travel further in forest environments.However, when the researchers, looked at humans, they found something unusual seems to have happened.While in our evolutionary past our voices may once have been much deeper, this has been changed by subsequent evolutionary pressures for our ability to speak.The findings, however, may go some way towards explaining the evolutionary origin of why women will often find men with low voices sexy.By producing deep resonance calls, male deer (pictured) can make themselves seem much larger than they really are. As females are attracted to this, over time adaptations that make calls deeper have become more prevelantStrangely, the research also suggests having a low pitched voice does not necessarily mean an individual will be the best choice as a mate.The researchers found that in species where the males had higher pitched calls, they also tended to have larger testicles compared to their body size.Dr Charlton said: 'We often see this in species where the females mate with lots of males.'In this case it makes little sense to invest energy in developing large vocal tracts if the the competition is going on after mating between sperm.'Instead it is better to produce lots of sperm and invest in that side of it.'
