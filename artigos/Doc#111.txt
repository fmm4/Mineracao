There are so many opportunities here at HEROS.’HEROS is supported by a Board of Trustees, Patrons, Ambassadors, including double Olympic cycling champion Victoria Pendleton, seven-times champion jumps jockey John Francome and trainer Richard Hughes.Muir added: ‘I am extremely proud of what the charity has achieved over the past 10 years but I know that we can help more ex-racehorses if we can raise the funds.‘Through our collaboration with the NTF, supported by the Racing Foundation, we also have the opportunity to help people progress through their racing career as well.‘Events such as our Windsor Raceday are vital to raise funds for the charity and build awareness of the developing education programmes.’You can support Marcus Townend’s ride in the HEROS race at: https://www.justgiving.com/fundraising/MarcusTownend-HEROS-HorseraceChallengeNo comments have so far been submitted.
