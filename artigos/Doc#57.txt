The 'ring of fire' over Africa: Incredible eclipse stuns stargazers as the Earth, moon and sun align



Stargazers in south and central Africa were treated to a spectacular solar eclipse Thursday with the moon moving across the sun to form a 'ring of fire'.At the eclipse's peak, all that was visible was a ring of light encircling the black moon.But the phenomenon was only fully visible to people in a narrow, 62 mile (100km) band stretching across central Africa, Madagascar and Reunion.Anyone north, south, east or west of the band experienced only a partial eclipse, or none at all.At the eclipse's peak, all that was visible was a ring of light encircling the black moon. Spectators had to don special protective glasses to filter out the sun's harmful ultraviolet and infra-red raysThe phenomenon, known as an annular solar eclipse, happens when there is a near-perfect alignment of the Earth, moon and sun.But unlike a total eclipse, when the sun is blacked out, sometimes the moon is too far from Earth, and its apparent diameter too small, for complete coverage.'I wanted to see it because even my daughters will be too old to watch the next one in 200 years,' joked Jeremy Grondin, who watched the event with his two young daughters in the south west of France's Indian Ocean Reunion Islands.It was there that stargazers had the best view of the solar eclipse, described by Pascal Descamps of the Paris astronomical observatory as a 'magical moment'.The annular eclipse delighted people in central Africa as a luminous ring of sunlight peered out from begind the moon. But the phenomenon was only fully visible to people in a narrow, 62-mile (100-kilometre) band stretching across central Africa, Madagascar and ReunionOn the island, the moment lasted just 2 minutes 33 seconds and took place shortly after 10am GMT.Spectators had to don special protective glasses to filter out the sun's harmful ultraviolet and infra-red rays.Viewers could also use a pinhole camera, a box with a hole on one side for light to pass through, projecting an inverted image of the eclipse on the opposite side.On the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte off the east coast of Africa, prayers were said in mosques calling for residents to be spared from harm.A man uses special safety glasses to view the eclipse in Saint Pierre, Reunion island (pictured left), while others opted for a less conventional approach to shield themselves from the sun's rays, such as this woman in Saint-Louis, on the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion (right)A combination of pictures shows the beginning to the end (top left to bottom right) of an annular solar eclipse seen from a beach of the French Indian Ocean island of La ReunionPeople across the French island territory of La Reunion, West of Madagascar, stopped to look at the celestial event. Viewers used special glasses and filters to protect their eyes from harmful UV rays and reduce the light intensity enough to witness the solar spectacleA series of images taken yesterday from Saint-Louis, on the Indian Ocean island of La Reunion, shows the moon moving to cover the sun during an annular solar eclipseStargazers on La Reunion were among those with the best view of the solar eclipse, described by Pascal Descamps of the Paris astronomical observatory as a 'magical moment'A picture taken from Dar es Salaam in Tanzania showed the moon's partial coverage of the sun close to 9am GMTSome people in Dar es Salaam used a puddle of water to look at a annular solar eclipse in the cloudy sky overhead.
