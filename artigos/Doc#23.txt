It seems the number of people taking photos and writing statuses on Facebook is on the rise.But this might not be a bad thing, as new research shows these interactions on Facebook make people happier.Personal interactions on the site can have a major impact on a person's well-being and satisfaction with life - just as much as getting married or having a baby, according to a new study.Nowadays it seems the number of people taking photos and writing statuses with an aim to get as many comments as possible is on the rise. But this might not be a bad thing, as new research shows these interactions on Facebook make people happier (stock image used)The study, conducted by Carnegie Mellon University and Facebook researchers, showed personalised posts and comments make people happier.But simpler interactions such as 'likes' do not have the same effect.What makes people feel good is when those they know and care about write personalised posts or comments, the researchers said.'We're not talking about anything that's particularly labour-intensive,' said Dr Moira Burke, a research scientist at Facebook.'This can be a comment that's just a sentence or two. The important thing is that someone such as a close friend takes the time to personalise it.Personal interactions on Facebook can have a major impact on a person's well-being and satisfaction with life - just as much as getting married (pictured) or having a baby, according to the new study (stock image used)'The content may be uplifting, and the mere act of communication reminds recipients of the meaningful relationships in their lives.'The study, published by the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication, was based on 1,910 Facebook users from 91 countries.Each agreed to take a monthly survey for three months and to have their responses combined with anonymous accounts of their Facebook behaviour from the previous month.The researchers found sixty comments from close friends within one month were associated with increases in users' psychological well-being as large as those associated with major life events.The findings by Dr Burke and Robert Kraut, a professor in CMU's Human-Computer Interaction Institute, contradict many previous studies, which showed time spent on social media is associated with a greater likelihood of loneliness and depression.'You're left to wonder - is it that unhappy people are using social media, or is social media affecting happiness?' Professor Kraut said.'It turns out that when you talk with a little more depth on Facebook to people you already like, you feel better,' Professor Kraut said. 'That also happens when people talk in person.'By considering mood and behaviour over time, the new study revealed Facebook interactions with friends predicted improvements in such measures of well-being as satisfaction with life, happiness, loneliness and depression.'This suggests that people who are feeling down may indeed spend more time on social media, but they choose to do so because they've learned it makes them feel better,' Dr Burke said.'They're reminded of the people they care about in their lives.'The study, published by the Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication , was based on 1,910 Facebook users from 91 countries.
