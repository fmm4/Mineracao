Is Sony building an emotional robot that can do house chores? Company chief, Kazuo Hirai, hints at AI plans



While Sony is currently one of the leading producers of smartphones, cameras and home entertainment systems, the company may soon be heading into the realm of robotics and AI.On Thursday, Kazuo Hirai, CEO of the Tokyo-based company, took to the stage at the IFA electronics show in Berlin to discuss the firm's newest products.He said that Sony was keen to explore new areas of technology, and that artificial intelligence and robotics were part of that.Kazuo Hirai, CEO of Sony said that the company was keen to explore new areas of technology, and that artificial intelligence and robotics were part of that. He also hinted that Sony could soon be making a house robot (stock image)The move towards robotics and AI is part of Sony's 'last one inch' mantra, that refers to getting products close to consumers.Mr Hirai said: 'I think the combination of 'the last one inch' - things that you hold in your hand to access or upload information, entertainment and so on - combined with AI and robotics is the area that is going to be a future growth area in a big way for Sony.'One of the reasons we currently believe that, is that we used to create things like the Aibo (robotic dog) and the Qrio robot - that was never put into market - but we have a lot of robotics and electronics know-how within the organisation.'We have a lot of sensor technology, we obviously have a lot of AI technology as well and we feel that when you look at all the asset bases that we have, getting into robotics and combining it with AI is a natural result.'Mr Hirai also dismissed the suggestions that AI-driven robots could be a threat, something that Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, has previously claimed.He said: 'I think that really depends on what sort of AI we're talking about and what area we're talking about as well.Sony also unveiled the Xperia XZ phone at the conference, which is said to offer a more intelligent, personalised experience, with a range of new features, including a smart battery and new laser camera technology'To say "we should be concerned", just with a broad stroke brush, I think, is actually very dangerous.'If Sony comes up with a robot for the house, is the AI involved in that dangerous or not? Consumers ultimately decide but I think it's a little bit of a general statement - too general.'In June this year, Mr Hirai said the firm was on a mission to make a 'robot capable of forming an emotional bond with customers, and able to grow to inspire love and affection'.Sony's latest products include the Xperia XZ smartphone, and a new earpiece that reads your phone notifications to you, which Mr Hirai said shows that thought is being put into the future.He added: 'Things like the Xperia Ear are ways in which we're exploring new opportunities beyond smartphones.'
