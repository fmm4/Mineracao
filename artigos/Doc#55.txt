Researchers find a SECOND 'Dyson sphere' star - but say strange fluctuations on both could simply be caused by dust



Since last October, an unusual star has baffled astronomers with strange dips in its brightness, prompting many to speculate about a possible alien 'Dyson sphere' megastructure that could be blocking the light.Along with these irregular fluctuations, scientists recently discovered that the entire star has dimmed by roughly 20 percent over the course of a century, further adding to the mystery.In a new explanation, however, an astrophysicist describes a scenario that could debunk the alien megastructure theory – and researchers may have found another star that fits the mold.The mysterious 'Dyson sphere' star may be in a newly discovered stage of evolution, he argues, with naturally occurring phenomena explaining the bizarre 'flux dips.'Since last October, an unusual star has baffled astronomers with strange dips in its brightness, prompting many to speculate about a possible alien 'Dyson sphere' megastructure that could be blocking the light. An artist's impression of a Dyson sphere is shownThe mysterious star, known as KIC 8462852 or ‘Tabby’s star,’ may be surrounded by a protoplanetary disk that’s oriented ‘edge-on’ in relation to Earth, explains astrophysicist Ethan Siegel, writing for Forbes’ Starts With a Bang.While these disks are known to emit infrared light, this alignment would make this radiation invisible to us.And, though it's been thought that this star is likely hundreds of millions of years old, some experts have argued that it may be much younger.‘Young Stellar Objects (YSOs) are known to have the large flux dips that this weird star has, and they’ve recently been shown to come in a variety of inclination angles,’ Siegel notes.The astrophysicist points to a new study, in which researchers observed a star called EPIC 204278916.This star experiences the similar dips to those seen in KIC 8462852, and is less than 11 million years old with a mass much lower than the Sun’s.Researchers observed flux dips in a star known as EPIC 204278916, seen in the graph above. They attribute this star's dips to two possible explanations: a warped inner disk transiting circumstellar clumps in circular orbits, and cometary-like debris in an eccentric orbitUsing Nasa’s Wise satellite and follow-up observations, the researchers detected infrared emissions, and have determined that its disk is inclined at roughly 57 degrees to our line of sight, give or take 9 degrees.The team attributes this star's flux dips to two possible explanations: a warped inner disk transiting circumstellar clumps in circular orbits, and cometary-like debris in an eccentric orbit.While the two stars do bear similarities, they are not alike in every way, the researchers explain.The observations reveal much deeper dips in EPIC 204278916 than those seen in KIC 8462852.Considering a scenario in which the star has an 'edge on' disk, the astrophysicist says the mysterious ‘alien megastructure’ could actually be natural phenomenon obscuring our view. An illustration is shown'Over the duration of the Kepler mission, KIC 8462852 was observed to undergo irregularly shaped, aperiodic dips in flux down to below the 20% level,' researchers revealed last monthAnd, these patterns occur ‘clustered in time,’ with one initial event followed by smaller ones over roughly 25 days before returning to the normal state.In KIC 8462852, these dips are not clustered, but instead occur over a period of several years – and, the star shows no accretion signatures.But as Siegel points out, an edge-on disk orientation could prevent astronomers from observing the infrared flux.Considering a scenario in which this is the case, the astrophysicist says the mysterious ‘alien megastructure’ could actually be natural phenomenon obscuring our view.If the star is actually younger than thought, and contains a warped inner disk or cometary-like debris as seen in EPIC 204278916, it could represent ‘a new stage in the early evolution of a class of stars,’ Siegel writes.
