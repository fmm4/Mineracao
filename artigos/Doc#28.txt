Pensioners are NOT bad drivers: The elderly are no more dangerous on the road than other motorists



The idea that older people are bad drivers is a myth, scientists have revealed.Research shows pensioners are no more dangerous on the road than other motorists – and they are safer than boy racers.In any case, forcing them to give up driving may be worse for their health than staying behind the wheel.Scroll down for videoResearch shows pensioners are no more dangerous on the road than other motorists – and they are safer than boy racers. Pictured is a still from the ITV documentary '100 Year Old Drivers'Swansea University researcher Charles Musselwhite said: 'My research suggests that while people think older people are dangerous on the road – they aren't.'People also think testing older people will make the roads safer – it won't.'I think this is a cohort that should continue to drive and we should see older people being allowed to drive as long as they feel fit and able to.'The combination of longer lives, fragmented families and out-of-town shops means that more older people want to drive than ever before.Today, some 4.5 million over-70s are on the road – including 236 aged 100-plus.The oldest licence holder is a man of 108.But with general health, reaction time, eyesight and hearing all declining with age and official statistics showing pensioners much more likely to die on the road, there have been calls for OAPs to be forced to retake their driving test.With general health, reaction time, eyesight and hearing all declining with age and official statistics showing pensioners much more likely to die on the road, there have been calls for OAPs to be forced to retake their driving testCurrently, Britons must reapply for their licence every three years from the age of 70.Rule vary by state in the US, but older drivers are similarly penalised. For instance, in California, drivers aged 70 and above must renew their licence in person, taking a written test and eye exam.Dr Musselwhite told a major science conference that he has done a decade of research that shows that testing older drivers would not make the roads any safer.Statistics show that older people are more likely to be killed or seriously injured in car accidents.But Dr Musselwhite said this isn't simply due to them having lots more crashes, instead it seems their frailty makes injuries more deadly.Similarly, police reports show older people are more likely to be blamed for crashes but Dr Musselwhite said that the type of crash is different – with pensioners being more likely to struggle with right turns across traffic than other age groups.His own research shows many older people feel under pressure when trying to turn right at a busy junction without traffic lights – suggesting that if other motorists were more accommodating, the figures would fall.Other possibilities include introducing a 'pensioner plate', similar to an L-plate, which would alert other motorists to the fact that they may need more timeOther possibilities include introducing a 'pensioner plate', similar to an L-plate, which would alert other motorists to the fact that they may need more time.Evidence also includes data from other countries that shows that bringing in tests for older drivers doesn't cut accident rates.The British Science Festival in Swansea heard that pensioners often compensate for their failing health by driving more carefully or by choosing quieter routes.Importantly, giving up driving can lead to a loss of independence and depression and raise the risk of falls and trips on icy and uneven roads and pavements, which could hasten death.Research shows that almost 90 per cent of pensioners don't walk quickly enough to cross the road while the green man is lit.And while pensioners make up just 19 per cent of pedestrians, they account for 40 per cent of pedestrian deaths.Dr Musselwhite said: 'Driving is a symbol of freedom, of independence, that you are still not that old.Research shows that almost 90 per cent of pensioners don't walk quickly enough to cross the road while the green man is lit. And while pensioners make up just 19 per cent of pedestrians, they account for of pedestrian deaths'It's not uncommon for older people to say when they give up driving that it feels like they have had their limbs cut off or that they are ready for the scrap heap.'He said that overall, they are just as safe on the roads as other users – and three to four times safer than males aged between 17 to 21.The RAC Foundation isn't in favour of introducing mandatory tests for older drivers.Instead, it says that motorists of all ages should regularly consider their fitness to drive.The motoring charity's spokesman Philip Gomm, said: 'Older drivers often get a bad rap as they actually tend to be some of the safest people on the road.'They often self-regulate and avoid situations where they feel uncomfortable such as driving during the rush hour, at night or on motorways.'While casualty rates start to rise quite for drivers in their late 80s and above this does not necessarily indicate they are causing more accidents, but that they are more likely to get hurt because of their increased physical frailty.'If you go by the statistics, then it is road users at the other end of the age spectrum that society would be better off helping stay safe.'
