That's a breath of fresh air! Rare dolphin learns to breathe through its mouth after injuring its blowhole



An endangered dolphin whose blowhole was deformed or became injured has learned to breathe through its mouth.Biologists studying a pod of Hector's dolphins off the coast of New Zealand were surprised to see the adult dolphin surfacing in an unusual way compared to other members of its group.Rather than breathing out of its blowhole like the rest of its species, the creature emerged from the water at a steep angle with its head higher than normal.Scroll down for videoAn adult Hector's dolphin has been found to be using its mouth to breathe after its blowhole was apparently injured or stopped working properly (pictured). The animal surfaces more steeply than other dolphins to take in gulps of air as it's head breaks the waterThis allowed it to take gulps of air as it broke the surface of the water before diving beneath the waves again.It is one of the only known examples of a dolphin learning to breathe through its mouth.Writing in the journal Marine Mammal Science, Professor Stephen Dawson, a marine biologist at the University of Otago in New Zealand, and his colleagues said: 'In every surfacing we observed, the dolphin approached the surface at a steep angle, with its head emerging higher than normal from the water surface.'The blowhole did not open widely as is normal.'While the blowhole appeared closed throughout each surfacing event, in surfacings seen at close range, a small puff of spray was visible from both blowhole and mouth as these cleared the surface at the beginning of the surfacing sequence.'The researchers believe the dolphin may have suffered an injury that stopped it from opening its blowhole properly or suffered from some sort of developmental problem.The only damage they could see to the animal's blowhole was a small lesion on one side.The dolphin (pictured) was found to adapt easily to its breathing difficulties and over a three year period of observations, scientists said it appeared to be completely healthyBlowholes in dolphins usually seal passively and muscles work to open them.Normally dolphins cannot breathe through their mouths as their larynx – which carries air to the lungs - projects through the esophagus, which carries food from the mouth.This means there is normally completely separation of the respiratory and digestive tracts.The dolphin could be heard taking gulps of air whenever it surfaced with its mouth open. Scientists say they could also see a fine mist coming from the animal's blow hole but it appeared to remain closed (pictured), suggesting it was not working correctlyBut the researchers note the animal must have learned to withdraw its larynx from its esophagus to allow it to breathe through the mouth.Video footage of the dolphin revealed it would open its mouth about 1-3 inches before it submerged again while it make an audible sucking noise as it breathed.Although similar behaviour has not been seen in any other dolphins or whales, captive dolphins are known to be able to blow bubbles out of their mouths after breathing air in their blowhole.Most Hector's dolphins breathe through their blowhole when they surface (pictured)A recent study also suggested injuries or blockages in blowholes in cetaceans may be more common than previously believed.Two long-finned pilot whales were found to have asphyxiated after common sole flatfish lodged in their nasal passages.Professor Dawson, who is also the founder of the New Zealand Whale and Dolphin Trust, said: 'Whatever the cause of the particular pathology we describe here, repeated sightings of this dolphin over 3 years, and its good current condition, indicate that the larynx works well enough for the animal to respire safely.'The observations demonstrate behavioural flexibility to deal with a pathological problem.'The views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.
