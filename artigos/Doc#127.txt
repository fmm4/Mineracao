England vs Pakistan first one-day international scorecard: Keep up with all the action at the Ageas Bowl



England will be looking to get off to a winning start when they play the first of five one-day internationals against Pakistan on Wednesday.Having drawn a thrilling Test series 2-2, Eoin Morgan takes the reins from Alastair Cook and will be looking to build on the hosts' strong form in limited overs cricket.England beat Sri Lanka 3-0 in the summer, including a memorable 10 wicket victory at Edgbaston when Alex Hales and Jason Roy smashed centuries to reach the target of 255 with almost 16 overs to spare.With England hosting the ICC Champions Trophy next summer, Morgan's side are entering the home straight as they look to hone their preparations.With Ben Stokes returning to the side as a specialist batsman and Mark Wood making his long-awaited comeback from injury, Morgan is enjoying the competition for places.'I'm loving it,' said Morgan. 'I've always said that, when a team's doing poorly, you get very few guys elsewhere piling on runs. But when you have a side doing well, you almost have a chain reaction – so those guys are very much on the radar.'England XI: Jason Roy, Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan(c), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler(wk), Moeen Ali, Chris Woakes, Adil Rashid, Liam Plunkett, Mark WoodPakistan XI: Azhar Ali(c), Sharjeel Khan, Mohammad Hafeez, Babar Azam, Shoaib Malik, Sarfraz Ahmed(wk), Mohammad Nawaz.
