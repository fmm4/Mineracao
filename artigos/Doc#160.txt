After the victory over Pakistan at Old Trafford in the second Test, England head to Edgbaston with renewed confidence of toppling Misbah-ul-Haq's side.Captain Alastair Cook and the selectors have chosen to recall seamer Steven Finn as the hosts aim to make the most of a tough wicket at their 500th home Test at Edgbaston against Pakistan.Indeed, Pakistan have their own grand ideas of becoming the best team in the world and want to claim victory to carry them one step further towards their goal.Sportsmail columnist Nasser Hussain has written in the build-up to this Test that Gary Ballance has to learn from Cook if he is to understand the patience required when facing Pakistan's attack.He writes that Ballance has started searching for scoring opportunities and that is what has got him into trouble.He adds: 'At Lord's, he went too far across his stumps to Yasir Shah and was bowled behind his legs. At Old Trafford, with the Pakistan attack at his mercy after that big stand between Cook and Joe Root, he chopped on, trying to cut a ball that was too close to him.'You can follow Sportsmail's live coverage of every over HERE, or keep track of the live scorecard on this page.No comments have so far been submitted.
