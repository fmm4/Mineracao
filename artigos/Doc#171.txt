'Caravaggio is the fastest we've ever had': Aidan O'Brien heaps praise on unbeaten horse after comfortable victory at the Curragh



Aidan O'Brien labelled Caravaggio 'the fastest we've ever had' after witnessing the unbeaten son of Scat Daddy provide him with a 15th victory in the Keeneland Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh.Sent off a red-hot 1-8 favourite in the five-strong field, Caravaggio completed a fourth career success in emphatic fashion, slamming stablemate Courage Under Fire by four imperious lengths to land a first Group 1 success.'He's a very good horse. The last morning he worked he went 45mph on the GPS system we use and we've never had a horse before that has hit that as their top speed,' revealed O'Brien who later witnessed an abject display from Air Force Blue who finished tailed off in the Phoenix Sprint Stakes.Caravaggio, ridden by Seamus Heffernan, won the Keeneland Phoenix Stakes at the Curragh'He's obviously very quick, it's all pace with him but he has a great mind and is very relaxed.'We'd have a look at the Prix Morny, but we wouldn't be in a panic with him now.'Asked about staying the mile in next year's 2000 Guineas for which Caravaggio is 4-1 favourite with Paddy Power, O'Brien replied: 'He might stay further as he is so relaxed, but he's so quick, the fastest we've ever had that we'll have to see.'Owner Derrick Smith goes to meet his horse in the winners enclosure after the raceMeanwhile, Dutch Connection failed to follow up a recent Goodwood win in a dramatic Prix Maurice de Gheest which was marred by the ill-fated fall of Gold-Fun inside the final furlong.Dutch Connection could only managed fourth as Signs Of Blessing, third to Twilight Sun in the Diamond Jubilee Stakes at Royal Ascot, made all to pocket the Group 1 prize for trainer Francois Rohaut.Meanwhile, Frankie Dettori was beaten aboard favourite Architecture in the German Oaks so still requires two to reach 3,000 career winners.
