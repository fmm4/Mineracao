Spiders 'tune' their webs to catch prey: Tension in the silk strings could what they will eat for dinner



Their rippling legs may make your skin crawl, but spiders are clever creatures.The eight-legged 'musicians' tune their strings to catch prey, according to a new study.Experts have found webs are superbly-tuned instruments and the type of information sent along the silken strands can be controlled by adjusting tension and stiffness – essentially, like tuning a guitar or violin.Scroll down for videoExperts have found webs are superbly tuned instruments and the type of information sent along the silken strands can be controlled by adjusting tension and stiffness – essentially, like tuning a guitar or violin (stock image)Spider silk transmits vibrations across a wide range of frequencies, carrying information that spiders can use to locate prey, mates and even check the structural integrity of their web.Researchers from the Oxford Silk Group, Oxford University's Department of Engineering Science and experts from Universidad Carlos III's Department of Continuum Mechanics and Structural Analysis in Madrid, studied the links between web vibration and web silk properties, using the garden spider Araneus diadematus.Web-dwelling spiders have poor vision and rely almost exclusively on web vibrations for their 'view' of the world.The musical patterns coming from their webs provide them with crucial information on the type of prey caught and of predators approaching, as well as the quality of prospective mates.The study, published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface found spider web vibration is affected by changes in web tension, silk stiffness and web architecture, all of which the spider is able to control.To explore how vibrations travel through a web, the team used a combination of cutting-edge techniques, including high-powered lasers to measure the ultra-small vibrations.In order to explore how vibrations travel through a web, the team used cutting-edge techniques to measure the ultra-small vibrations. This allowed them to generate computer models to test the links between the spread of vibrations and material properties of websThis allowed them to generate computer models to understand the links between the spread of vibrations and material properties of webs.The results suggest the spider can control the function of its web instrument, tuning it like an eight-legged Jimi Hendrix.Dr Beth Mortimer, lead author of the report, said: 'Spider orb webs are multifunctional structures, where both the transmission of vibrations and the capture of prey are important.'Professor Fritz Vollrath, Head of the Oxford Silk Group, added: 'It is down to the interaction of the web materials, a range of bespoke web silks, and the spider with its highly tuned behaviour and armoury of sensors that allows this virtually blind animal to operate in a world of its own making, without vision and only relying on feeling.'Perhaps the web spider can teach us something new about virtual vision.'The 'musical' ability of spiders has been overlooked until recent years.Speaking about the original study, co-author Dr Chris Holland of the University of Sheffield said: 'We find that the [webs] are an awesome communication tool.'Yet again spiders continue to impress us in more ways than we can imagine.'The results suggest that the spider can use behaviour and silk properties to control the function of its web instrument, tuning it like an eight-legged Jimi Hendrix.
