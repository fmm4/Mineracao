Crotty beat attempted tackles by Dane Haylett-Petty, Giteau and a desperate effort by Will Genia to score. Barrett converted the try for a 7-3 lead.Moments after, Giteau suffered a left-ankle injury and the 103-test veteran had a pronounced limp as he left the field which will concern his European club, ToulonThe world champions then added another two penalties, before Barrett raced through an opening in the Wallabies' wide defence to score another easy try. The fly-half kicked the conversion as the All Blacks took a 20-3 lead after 26 minutes.New Zealand centre Ryan Crotty flies past Australia nine Will Genia as he scores the All Blacks' first try of the gameCrotty, right, celebrates with New Zealand winger Ben Smith after his first-half try against the WallabiesThe Wallabies' injury woes worsened minutes later as Toomua suffered a head injury trying to tackle Barrett and was replaced by Horne.The contest was effectively over after half-an-hour as Foley's clearing kick was charged down by Jerome Kaino and the All Blank flanker chased after and gathered the ball before diving over for New Zealand's third try and a 25-3 lead.The rout continued with winger Waisake Naholo scoring just before half-time after Barrett made a break through the middle and passed inside to Naholo, who sped past Ben McCalman and Israel Folau.Barrett added the extras for a 32-3 score at the interval to leave the majority of the 65,328 crowd stunned.The All Blacks perform the haka before the Bledisloe Cup match begins at the ANZ Stadium in Sydney, AustraliaA scary-looking All Blacks fan enjoys the game, left, while an Australian supporter shows her true colours, rightNew Zealand picked up where they left off in the second period when Dane Coles - who replaced Codie Taylor in the first half - reached over, following an earlier dropped ball by Tevita Kuridrani.Almost straight from the restart, New Zealand attacked again with Barrett playing in Julian Savea who scored acrobatically in the corner as the score reached 42-3.A yellow card to All Blacks No 8 Kieran Read in the 73rd gave the Wallabies a brief period of attack and substitute Phipps found space out wide to score.The teams meet again in Wellington, New Zealand next week, where the All Blacks will have the chance to secure the Bledisloe Cup for a 14th straight year.
