Yalta could head for the Coolmore Nunthorpe Stakes at York following Molecomb success



Trainer Mark Johnston has confirmed last week's Molecomb Stakes winner Yalta is likely to be supplemented for the Coolmore Nunthorpe Stakes at York.Following two disappointing runs over six furlongs in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot and the July Stakes at Newmarket, the Exceed And Excel juvenile dropped to the minimum distance on the Sussex Downs last week and produced a dominant performance from the front under James Doyle.Even Johnston himself has admitted he was shocked by the performance, but he is now keen for him to line up at Group One level on the Knavesmire on August 19, where he will receive a significant weight-for-age allowance from his elders.Yalta won the Molecomb Stakes on July 27, breaking the course record in the processTrainer Mark Johnston was shocked by his horse's performance during the dominant win'It was a blistering performance. I was quite shocked, actually,' Johnston told At The Races.'I was amazed how much early speed he had down the hill. Clearly five (furlongs) is his trip.'I think the Gimcrack will probably be overlooked and ground dependent and well-being dependent, he'll probably be supplemented for the Nunthorpe.'Two-year-olds have got a good record in the race and he's a big, strong horse and was an early foal, so he's perhaps the ideal type for it.'Johnson is keen for him to line up at group one level at Knavesmire on August 19No comments have so far been submitted.
