Climate change is making the oceans SICK: Warming of the seas could be humanity's 'greatest hidden challenge'



While it has previously been recognised that global warming is causing ocean temperatures to rise, experts warn that we may be underestimating the damage.They say that global warming is making the oceans sicker than ever before, spreading disease among animals and humans and threatening food security across the planet.The experts warn that 'there is no doubt that we are the cause of this' and the only solution is to cut greenhouse gas emissions.They say warming of the oceans may become the 'greatest hidden challenge' of our generation', it said.The hotter oceans have killed off coral reefs at an unprecedented rate, reducing fish species by eliminating their habitatsThe findings were compiled by 80 scientists from 12 countries at the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Conservation Congress in Hawaii.Inger Anderson, Director General of the IUCN, said: 'We all know that the oceans sustain this planet.'We all know that the oceans provide every second breath we take, and yet we are making the oceans sick.'The report, 'Explaining Ocean Warming,' is the 'most comprehensive, most systematic study we have ever undertaken on the consequence of this warming on the ocean,' according to Professor Dan Laffoley, co-lead author.The world's waters have absorbed more than 93 per cent of the enhanced heating from climate change since the 1970s, curbing the heat felt on land but drastically altering the rhythm of life in the ocean.Professor Laffoley said: 'The ocean has been shielding us and the consequences of this are absolutely massive.'Populations of sea turtles could turn all-female if humans do not take measures to control the earth's rising temperaturesThe study included every major marine ecosystem, containing everything from microbes to whales, including the deep ocean.It documents evidence of jellyfish, seabirds and plankton shifting toward the cooler poles by up to 10 degrees latitude.According to Mr Laffoley, the movement in the marine environment is '1.5 to five times as fast as anything we are seeing on the ground.'The higher temperatures will probably change the sex ratio of turtles in the future because females are more likely to be born in warmer temperatures.The heat also means microbes dominate larger areas of the ocean.Pathogens such as cholera-bearing bacteria and toxic algal blooms that can cause neurological illnesses such as ciguatera poisoning spread more easily in warm water, with direct impact on human health'When you look overall, you see a comprehensive and worrying set of consequences,' Professor Laffoley said.The study also includes evidence that ocean warming is causing increased disease in plant and animal population.Pathogens such as cholera-bearing bacteria and toxic algal blooms that can cause neurological illnesses spread more easily in warm water, with direct impact on human health.Professor Laffoley said: 'We are no longer the casual observers in the room.'What we have done is unwittingly put ourselves in the test tube where the experiment is being undertaken.'Meanwhile, the hotter oceans have killed off coral reefs at an unprecedented rate, reducing fish species by eliminating their habitats.The loss of reefs cuts down on the abundance of certain fish, with implications for food security.'In Southeast Asia, harvests from marine fisheries are expected to fall by between 10 per cent and 30 per cent by 2050 relative to 1970-2000, as the distributions of fish species shift,' said the report.The loss of coral reefs cuts down on the abundance of certain fish, with implications for food securityThe report highlights the need for swift action on renewable energies..'We need to cut greenhouse gases,' said Carl Gustaf Lundin, director of the global marine and polar program at IUCN.'There is no doubt in all our minds that we are the cause of this.'We know what the solutions are. We need to get on with it.
