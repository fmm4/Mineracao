Roman infanticide was NOT as common as thought: Scans of ancient baby bones reveal many were stillborn



The tiny bones of infants in ancient cemeteries around Britain have given Romans a reputation of being cold and merciless.But researchers using an innovative method of scanning bones have revealed that these tiny bodies were not the victims of vicious infanticide at all.Instead it appears many of the infants were stillborns, buried in cemeteries alongside other adults, suggesting they were mourned by their families.Researchers have used an innovative method of scanning bones in the hopes of improving our understanding of child mortality in Roman BritainHistorians had suggested the infants could have been murdered shortly after birth as an attempt to control family sizes or even to ensure a family had more boys than girls.The results, however, suggest infanticide was not as widespread as previously believed, with many cases actually being stillborn.The study was led by researchers from the Natural History Museum, Museum of London and Durham University.Dr Thomas Booth, co-author of the study, said: 'Distinguishing between the remains of stillborn and liveborn infants is important to archaeologists to judge the health of past populations and to understand how past societies regarded these young deaths.'There are many examples of cultures both past and present whose ideologies led them to regard these young deaths in a way that meant they had to be treated differently.'This can be seen relatively recently in the exclusion of unbaptised infants from Catholic cemeteries.'A x-ray microtomography (Micro-CT) scanner allowed the researchers to compare microscopic surfaces inside the bones, without causing any damageThe researchers looked at ten infant skeletons from cemeteries around London.A x-ray microtomography (micro-CT) scanner allowed the researchers to compare microscopic surfaces inside the bones, without causing any damage.The scans showed that most of the bones were undamaged.A few weeks into a child's life, gut bacteria begin to form, which will damage bones after death in a process called bioerosion.The fact that the bones were undamaged suggests they belonged to stillborns who had not yet developed the gut bacteria.Previous studies have cut open bone and tooth samples to look at the internal structure.However, this was not representative of the whole bone, and damaged the skeleton.The scans showed that most of the bones were undamaged. A few weeks into a child's life, gut bacteria begin to form, which will damage bones after death in a process called bioerosion. The fact that the bones were undamaged suggests they belonged to stillbornsDr Booth said: 'The ability to more accurately differentiate between stillborn and short-lived infants, without having to alter precious archaeological skeletons, will profoundly impact on the study of past human life.'The researchers now hope to do further studies to improve our understanding of the lives of people in Roman Britain.Dr Rebecca Redfern, co-author of the study, said: 'The size of the Museum of London's 20,000-strong collection of skeletons means we are uniquely placed to investigate research questions such as this one, as well as to provide meaningful interpretation of the results with our detailed archive information.'We can now apply this research to infant skeletons in our collection from periods other than Roman London to investigate mortality risks and how these relate to London's ever-changing environment and population.'
