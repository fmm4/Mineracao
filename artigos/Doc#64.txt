Bad at maths? Blame your PARENTS: An adult's number skills 'rub off' on their children, say scientists



If algebra leaves you cold, then it's not just your lack of practice - your parents could be to blame.A new study suggests that parents' maths skills 'rub off' on children.This means that parents who themselves excel with numbers, are likely to produce children who do too.A new study suggests that parents transfer their skills in maths to their children, meaning that parents who themselves excel with numbers, are likely to produce children who do too (stock image)The research comes from the University of Pittsburgh, where scientists explored intergenerational transmission – parental influence on children – in maths.Dr Melissa Libertus, who led the study, said: 'Our findings suggest an intuitive sense for numbers has been passed down—knowingly or unknowingly—from parent to child.'Essentially, the math skills of parents tend to "rub off" on their children.'This research could have significant ramifications for how parents are advised to talk about math and numbers with their children and how teachers go about teaching children in classrooms.'The study involved 54 children aged between five and eight, as well as 51 parents – all of whom had achieved a high school degree as a minimum.The children were given three maths tests, designed to gauge their baseline numerical skills.The parents were also given a maths test, as well as a survey on the importance of children developing maths skills.Results showed that the performance level in the children could reliably be predicted by their parents' performance.While other studies have looked at how cognitive skills are passed down from parents, this is the first to find evidence of maths skills being inherited (stock image)Surprisingly, the researchers also found that the children's intuitive sense of numbers – for example, knowing that 20 jelly beans are more than 10 without first counting them – is predicted by their parents intuitive sense of numbers.While other studies have looked at how cognitive skills are passed down from parents, this is the first to find evidence of maths skills being inherited.Dr Libertus said: 'We believe the relationship between a parent and a child's math capabilities could be some combination of hereditary and environmental transmission.'The ongoing debate of nature versus nurture questions whether human behaviour is pre-wired or influenced by environmental factors.Nature is what we think of as pre-wiring and is influenced by genetic inheritance and other biological factors.Nurture is generally taken as the influence of external factors after conception - the product of exposure, experience and learning on an individual.The researchers hope to conduct further studies that will look at the genetic and environmental influences on maths skills.They hope that this could help create an optimal in-home learning environment to improve maths skills.
