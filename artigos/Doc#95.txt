An inventor has created a mug that keeps your drink at the perfect temperature for 30 minutesThomas Gostelow, an inventor from Chorlton, claims to have designed the world's first fine china heated smart mug.And he thinks it could spell the end of that irritating trip to the microwave for millions of drinkers whose brew has gone tepid.The Glowstone looks and feels like any other mug but it automatically keeps drinks at the perfect temperature.Mr Gostelow now hopes a crowdfunding campaign will get his prototypes into full production and could create jobs for skilled local engineers.The mug is made of fine bone china (left) so it feels like any other mug in your hand. It features a light (top right) which indicates when it is heating. It is also dishwasher friendly (middle right) and charges wirelessly (bottom right)The product designer first came up with the idea two years ago after buying a coffee machine.He said: 'The coffee tasted great and the process of brewing meant it came out at the ideal temperature, but that only lasted for the first couple of sips.'In addition, I would get distracted and forget about it until it went cold.'I tried heated metal and plastic mugs but didn't like how they changed the taste.'When he couldn't find a mug which kept his drink warm, Mr Gostelow decided to make one himself.The mug uses a tiny heater, wirelessly rechargeable batteries and electronics which are all dishwasher-proof.The mug can be wirelessly charged by placing it onto a Qi coaster, which can also charge smartphonesIt can be wirelessly charged by placing it onto a Qi coaster, which can also charge smartphones.The mug then switches off when it detects that the last sip has gone or after 30 minutes.Mr Gostelow spent 18 months sourcing parts, developing the electronics and refining the idea with friends and family before making a prototype.He said: 'The results were better than expected. Not only was it keeping my drinks hot, they seemed to taste better.'We're onto version four and while we've added useful features. We've kept it simple and made the mug fully automatic.'All you have to do is charge it - the mug does everything else, apart from wash itself.'A Kickstarter funding campaign has now been set-up, where backers can pre-order mugs for shipment in time for Christmas.Mr Gostelow added: 'Having pre-orders through Kickstarter means that our backers will benefit from our mugs at a lower price as they pay up front.'All we need is enough of them.'A pledge of £69 ($90) will get you one mug with a charger. The mugs are expected to ship in December.Within a 22 mm deep recess in the base, are two rechargeable lithium-ion batteries, a film thermistor, a heater, a wireless power receiver and other sensors and electronics that make it fully automatic and easy to use.
