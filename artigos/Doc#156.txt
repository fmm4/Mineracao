The Rio Olympic Games kick off with the opening ceremony on August 6 - Sportsmail has put together a guide to the top six non-British athletes to look out for in Brazil.Michael Phelps - Swimming - Age: 31The most successful Olympian of all, the gangly American Michael Phelps, is out of retirement for one last hurrah aged 31. A sometime wild boy, he is now a father of a baby son called Boomer and will be trying to add to his 18 ribbons of gold. His clash with the world champion Chad le Clos, of South Africa, in the 100m butterfly will be one of the must-see events of week one.The most successful Olympian of all, Michael Phelps, is out of retirement for a last hurrahGenzebe Dibaba - Athletics (1500m and 5,000m) - Age: 25A female track star of Bolt-like dominance. The 25-year-old Ethiopian has set the record books ablaze – holding world bests at 1500 metres, 3,000m and 5,000m. She is favourite for the 1500m and 5,000m in Rio. One asterisk is that her coach, Jama Aden, was arrested earlier this year when police found doping substances in his hotel room.Genzebe Dibaba is the favourite for both the 1500m and the 5,000m races in Rio this monthDafne Schippers - Athletics (100m & 200m) - Age: 24The fastest women in the world this year over 200m. Can the Dutch athlete possibly break the Caribbean-American stranglehold on the sprinting medals? Having moved from the heptathlon to full-time sprinting, her performances have rocketed, with gold in the 200m and silver in the 100m at the Beijing World Championships last July. The longer distance again offers her the best chance of a title.Dafne Schippers will be looking to the 200m for her best chance of a titleWayde van Niekerk - Athletics (400m) - Age: 24The potential winner of a mouth-watering 400 metres, having won gold at the World Championships in Beijing last year. The South African faces stiff competition, mind, from the Grenadian string bean Kirani James and American former drugs cheat LaShawn Merritt. Van Niekerk’s time in Beijing (43.48sec) was faster than anyone else in the Rio field has ever run, though Merritt has set the pace this season (43.97sec).Wayde van Niekerk won gold at the 2015 World Championships and is a potential winnerKatie Ledecky - Swimming - Age: 19Can she become the Michael Phelps of women’s swimming? She put a marker down by winning gold in the 800m freestyle at London aged 15, and now is the best in the world over 200m, 400m, 800m and 1500m. With three world records to her name, the American seems to be getting quicker and quicker. Her opposition in the 800m? Nobody but the clock.Katie Ledecky could become the Phelps of women's swimming and is the best in the worldChristian Taylor - Triple Jump - Age: 26Is Jonathan Edwards’ distant triple jump record finally under threat? It has stood for 21 years but America’s Christian Taylor flew to within 8cm of it in winning the 2015 world title. But was his leap a one-off? It was the only time he has gone beyond 18m. His Edwards-inspired target is 18.29m. His best this year is 17.78, set at the Anniversary Games in London.Christian Taylor could be the man to break Jonathan Edwards' 21-year record in triple jump.
