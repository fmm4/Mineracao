Premier League football is back, with champions Leicester getting the season off and running against Hull on Saturday lunchtime.It's been a summer dominated by high profile transfers and managerial appointments, with Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Paul Pogba, Jose Mourinho, Pep Guardiola and Antonio Conte all adding extra excitement as the big kick-off rapidly approaches.But who is the signing of the summer? Who will win the title? Which youngster is destined to make a breakthrough? And which teams are destined for a relegation battle?Sportsmail's team of top columnists and reporters have their say ahead of the start of another Premier League season.Zlatan Ibrahimovic got off to the perfect start with the winner in the Community ShieldPep Guardiola has been charged with taking Manchester City to the top of European footballChelsea have appointed Antonio Conte as they bid to improve on last season's dismal showJAMIE REDKNAPPPremier League champions: Manchester CityRest of top four: Manchester United, Tottenham, LiverpoolRelegated: Watford, Burnley, HullFA Cup: ArsenalLeague Cup: ChelseaChampions League: Bayern MunichJamie Redknapp has predicted Pep Guardiola to get off to a winning start at Manchester CityJAMIE CARRAGHERPremier League champions: Manchester CityRest of top four: Chelsea, Manchester United, LiverpoolRelegated: Swansea, Hull, BurnleyFA Cup: ChelseaLeague Cup: LiverpoolChampions League: BarcelonaNo Premier League glory for Chelsea, but Jamie Carragher can see them winning the FA CupMARTIN KEOWNPremier League champions: Manchester CityRest of top four: Manchester United, Arsenal, TottenhamRelegated: Hull, Sunderland, BurnleyFA Cup: LiverpoolLeague Cup: ChelseaChampions League: Bayern MunichBut Martin Keown believes Jurgen Klopp and Liverpool will lift the FA Cup trophyIAN LADYMANPremier League champions: Manchester CityRest of top four: Manchester United, Tottenham, ChelseaRelegated: Hull, Watford, SwanseaFA Cup: Manchester CityLeague Cup: Manchester UnitedChampions League: Bayern MunichMike Phelan has a job on his hands at Hull, until a permanent manager is appointed that isMATT BARLOWPremier League champions: Manchester UnitedRest of Top four: Chelsea, Manchester City, TottenhamRelegated: Hull, Swansea, BurnleyFA Cup: Manchester CityLeague Cup: ChelseaChampions League: BarcelonaMatt Barlow can see Lionel Messi and Barcelona winning the Champions LeagueROB DRAPERWho is the signing of the summer?N’Golo Kante. He was undoubtedly the signing of last summer at £5m and even at six times that figure, I think he’ll repeat the accolade. If the formula is value for money + impact on his team, then Kante is the answer.Which youngster will make the big breakthrough?He’s already made the first steps but I wonder whether some of Arsenal’s more-exalted stars might find themselves with more bench time as Alex Iwobi develops. Find it hard to understand how England didn’t do more to make sure he played international football for the country he’s lived in since the age of fourN'Golo Kante cost Chelsea £30m this summer, six times the £5m he cost Leicester last yearWho will be this season’s surprise package?Everton. ‘Surprise’ in so much that they will push for a place in the top four, even if they ultimately fall away at the end. Not quite the magnitude of last season’s surprise but still….What will happen next with Leicester?Solid season in the top eight, maybe pushing for Europa League qualification at the end. But they’ll qualify out of their group in the Champions League and, with a favourable draw, can make the quarter finals.One wish for the new season?Some proper quality football in Premier League rather than bish, bosh, bash entertainment we’ve become used to, which is cruelly exposed once the serious business in the Champions League comes aroundAshley Williams could be part of an Everton team pushing for a place in the top fourPremier League Champions: Man CityTop four: Man Utd, Chelsea, ArsenalRelegated: Burnley, Watford, HullFA Cup: LiverpoolLeague Cup: TottenhamThree promoted teams from Championship: Newcastle, Derby, BrightonDOMINIC KINGWho is the signing of the summer?Henrikh Mkhitaryan (Borussia Dortmund to Manchester United): For several reasons, this £29million deal did not get the kind of coverage you would necessarily expect but his arrival in the Premier League is huge for Manchester United. The Armenia international is a wonderful player, full of ingenuity and class. Given some of the prices other clubs have paid for certain players, United have certainly got value.Which youngster will make the big breakthrough?Tom Davies at Everton. He made his debut at the end of last season and looked every inch a Premier League performer in the making. He has signed a new long-term contract this summer and already had the experience of training with England’s senior team at St George’s Park. Davies has got a real chance to make a name for himself and, provided he progresses, he will get opportunities to sparkle for Everton this season.Could Henrikh Mkhitaryan, pictured with Jose Mourinho, be the signing of the season?Who will be this season’s surprise package?My initial idea was to say Leicester but I will deal with them in the next question. So I am going to say Arsenal. Plenty of people are predicting them to finish outside the top four but I think they are going to shock everyone. Their preparations have been good and if Arsene Wenger makes the signings he needs, they could fly.What will happen next with Leicester?The air is not going to come hissing out of this particular balloon any time soon. Yes, losing N’Golo Kante is a blow but their business has been excellent and they are club that screams stability. They won’t win the league but I don’t think they will fall out of the top eight. They won the league by 10 points. There was no fluke. They are an excellent side.Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger will be looking to mount a serious title challengeOne wish for the new season?That Arsenal fans recognise what Arsene Wenger has done for them over the last 20 years. If the title challenge doesn’t materialise, it would be a travesty to see a man who has built up a club and produced some of the greatest teams we will ever see found himself on the end of a booing campaign.Premier League Champions: ArsenalTop four: Manchester United, Manchester City, ChelseaRelegated: Hull, West Brom, WatfordFA Cup: Manchester CityLeague Cup: Manchester UnitedThree promoted teams from Championship: Newcastle, Aston Villa, Derby CountyJOE BERNSTEINWho is the signing of the summer?Jurgen Klopp has added bags of energy and pace in signing Georginio Wijnaldum and Sadio Mane. Wijnaldum scored 11 goals from midfield in a relegated team last season - his first in English football. Spurs and Everton were also keen, Liverpool could have a £25m snip on their hands.Which youngster will make the big breakthrough?At 22, Sunderland's Duncan Watmore isn't exactly a baby anymore but this should be a massive breakthrough season for him under David Moyes. Manager Moyes will love the work rate, movement and goal threat of the red-head striker. Sam Allardyce will have worked with him last season so while everyone talks about Jermain Defoe, don't be surprised to see Watmore called up by England at some stage.Who will be this season's surprise package?Watford. So far under the radar, you wouldn't even know they were in the Premier League. But they have a canny new Italian manager, Walter Mazzarri, and a host of good international signings to go with British talent like Ikechi Anya, Craig Cathcart and Troy Deeney. Their most expensive buy of the window is called Isaac Success. You can't beat that for optimism.Joe Bernstein believes Watford fans will be in for a thrilling seasonWhat will happen next with Leicester?They won't disappear but neither can I see them in the top four again, particularly with Champions League games in midweek and many of the players not having rested as usual because of Euro 2016. Recruitment has been good but the bookies have them down to finish about seventh and that sounds right.One wish for the new season?A blanket finish at the top of the Premier League. Can you imagine the excitement of five or six teams are still in contention at Easter. It'd be fascinating to see how Jose, Pep, Arsene and others react to that type of pressurePremier League champions: Man UnitedTop four: - Arsenal, Liverpool, Man CityRelegated: Hull, Burnley, SwanseaFA Cup: ChelseaLeague Cup: EvertonThree Promoted teams from Championship: Newcastle, Norwich, DerbyCRAIG HOPEWho is the signing of the summer?I saw Arsenal new boy Granit Xhaka twice for Switzerland at the Euros and he was outstanding. He was making in excess of 100 passes per game and very few of them went astray. There is an effortless class about the £35m midfielder.Which youngster will make the big breakthrough?I’ll pick two from the North-East patch. One isn’t so young, but Middlesbrough centre-back Ben Gibson, at 23, will be an England international by the end of the season. He is left-sided - something England are crying out for - and is strong, good in the air and can play, too. And then there is Sunderland striker Joel Asoro. The Swede is only 17 but is a box of tricks and, given Sunderland’s lack of options, he could be handed his chance sooner than expected.Both Ben Gibson of Middlesbrough and Sunderland's Joel Asoro could be set for big seasonsWho will be this season’s surprise package?Given that by tipping Spurs for the title I’ve been accused of losing the plot by colleagues, I’m going for them as the surprise package. If Man United had signed Harry Kane and Dele Alli this summer we’d be saying they were title favourites, wouldn’t we? They haven’t. They still play for Spurs. And so does the division’s best back five, plus the likes of Eric Dier and Christian Eriksen. They came close last season and will be better for that experience with a manager in Mauricio Pochettino who will surely go on to manager one of Europe’s very top clubs.What will happen next with Leicester?I saw them in a pre-season friendly at Celtic and they were very good. They won’t win the league, but I wouldn’t rule out a fourth-placed finish. After all, they’ve only lost N’Golo Kante - and don’t forget they won the title by 10 points! Riyad Mahrez remains the most exciting player in the Premier League and they appear to have bought well. They’ll take great satisfaction in proving people wrong this season. Again.Craig Hope has picked Tottenham to be the Premier League champions in 2016-17One wish for the new season?This may sound simplistic, but just some really good matches. Let’s be honest, the Euros was an awful advertisement for the sport. I was watching golf and cricket over the summer and thinking, “I actually enjoy this more than the football”. The Premier League can restore my faith with its high-octane, high-stakes unique brand of football.

United have spent zillions but what they really needed was a bit (lot) of ego and personality.Which youngster will make the big breakthrough?Marcus Rashford. Rooney doesn’t look the same player he was and Rashford could shine next to Ibrahimovic.Who will be this season’s surprise package?Arsenal, but in a bad way. I think there’s a chance, at this point in the window, that they’ve been left behind.Marcus Rashford (left) could be a young player to make a major breakthrough this seasonWhat will happen next with Leicester?They will be in the fight for Europa League places. The Champions League will be a wonderful experience but a drain domestically.One wish for the new season?For it to be even a fraction as good as the last one. So many great managers, it’ll be interesting to see who comes out on top. Some big egos are in a close fight.Premier League champions: Manchester UnitedTop four: Manchester City, Chelsea, TottenhamRelegated: Sunderland, Hull, MiddlesbroughFA Cup: TottenhamLeague Cup: ChelseaPromoted: Newcastle, Derby, BrightonRafa Benitez's Newcastle seem a unanimous choice for a return to the Premier LeagueJACK GAUGHANWho is the signing of the summer?Ilkay Gundogan (Dortmund to Manchester City, £21m). Pep Guardiola identified a passive midfield as an area of weakness at City and - although Gundogan won’t be match fit until September - has a player who will act as his ‘pivot’. Will be the one City expect to control games from between the two central defenders.Which youngster will make the big breakthrough?Matthew Pennington at Everton. An assured central defender, has been elevated up the Everton pecking order this summer. Yes, Ronald Koeman wants to bring in Ashley Williams and Lamine Kone but could see Phil Jagielka join John Stones in leaving. Big things are expected of Pennington.Who will be this season’s surprise package?Middlesbrough. Maybe that should read who ‘could’ be the surprise package, because this season will go either way for Boro under Aitor Karanka. They’ve brought in plenty, including Alvaro Negredo and Gaston Ramirez. Antonio Barragan has also joined from Valencia plus two new goalkeepers - Victor Valdes and Brad Guzan. Viktor Fischer from Ajax is another astute signing on the face of it and it is all dependant on whether they can click quickly.Nampalys Mendy has a job on his hands to replace N'Golo Kante in the Leicester midfieldWhat will happen next with Leicester?A solid season, certainly in the top eight. Nampalys Mendy - their new midfielder from Nice - has a job on his hands to fill the N’Golo Kante-shaped void. Ahmed Musa looks handy going forward and Jamie Vardy scored at the weekend, so Claudio Ranieri will feel they can challenge for Europe again.One wish for the new season?That price tags aren’t endlessly debated all season. The Premier League ate itself long ago, this summer has just heightened that with the new TV deal, and players - from Paul Pogba to Yannick Bolasie to Andre Ayew - are worth what buyers are willing to pay.Premier League champions: Manchester UnitedTop four: Man City, Chelsea, ArsenalRelegated: Hull, Burnley, WatfordFA Cup: TottenhamLeague Cup: LiverpoolThree promoted teams from Championship: Sheffield Wednesday, Newcastle, Ipswich TownIpswich Town could be an outside bet to earn promotion to the Premier League this season.
